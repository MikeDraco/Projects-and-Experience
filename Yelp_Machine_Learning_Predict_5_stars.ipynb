The bike was there for a few days so I decided to call to check the status and get an estimate of the work that I wanted done. I was told 3-5 hours and that the relay should be replaced. He also asked if I had a manual, which I didn't but found one online and emailed it to him. I also gave him 100 dollars for parts. They ended up charging me for 20hrs and 210 for parts for wiring, ignition, rectifier, relay, carb float gaskets, even though I said I didn't want to spend much. They only were going to charge me 450 total as the bike has been there for around 6 months. I tried to pick up the 3 occasions, each time waiting on average an hour for someone to show up after I set up the time. 1st time they didn't have change or an invoice. 2nd time the bike was leaking fuel profusely so it was unridable. 3rd time I finally was going to take the bike regardless of condition. I ended up paying 370 for everything for it after he threatened to sue me, but agreed to 270 additional and gave me 2 weeks to pay the extra or the warranty they offer was void. They also broke the key cover for the gas tank and lost the original key that would fit to get into the gas tank and for the saddle bags, luckily I had a spare.\n\nI would not recommend any business ran by Ray or anyone associated with him. I found him to be very unprofessional. No one actually walked me through what work was done, which appears the bike was not completely rewired as the switches and their wiring were not touch at all. I never even meet in person with Ray and found what he told me and what the mechanic told me usually never matched. I also was not told of what the additional cost of what additional work he thought needed to be done would be. They just went ahead and did it.

I say this without having ever ended my contract with them, so stay tuned. That may be my next review topic.\n - As a newer gym, it's still in fairly decent shape. There's still the 3 or 4 malfunctioning treadmills lying around, but overall, not too bad.\n - The classes are great and included with your membership, which was a big bonus, considering a lot of other gyms charge for classes. I've gone to a few and highly recommend a cycling class with Mckenzie - I don't think I've ever sweat so much in my life.\n\nCONS: \n - The front door \"greeters\" don't greet you. At all. They either scan your card or leave the little scanner out for you to do it yourself so they don't have to make eye contact with you.\n - There are a total of four water fountains for this 5 billion sq. ft. facility.\n - The sign \"don't drop your weights\" is either unread, ignored, or unable to be read by those tossing their 1,500-lb weights to the floor. For those who can read: watch your feet.\n - Far too many annoying grunting noises (if you look/feel like you're having a heart attack, maybe you shouldn't be lifting quite so much?) and male adolescent conversations that involve a lot of \"dudes\" and expletive female body parts. Bring your iPod or endure the TMI, your choice.\n - The pool is ALWAYS crowded with 2-3 people per lane, despite what your lying sales rep tells you. And if you can figure out when its hours are, then you just might be that lucky third person to the lane. \n - The music consists of either newer slow songs or golden 70s and 80s elevator music.

Beware this is not a place to go with a big party, and beware they charge $100.00 for the private room and with big parties they don't allow you to sit anywhere else then the private room. They add on tips and the service sucks.. They don't allow splitting the checks. The power went out our server never came to check on us once during the outage, if it wasn't for the bus boy we never would have gotten our drinks refilled, and it took 2.5 hours to get our food.. we attempted to make reservations earlier that day but they don't open til 5pm we called at 450pm and we're able to make a reservation were told that they would waived the room fee, when we got there they hunted me down to question me about the fee. I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children. After the 2.5 hour wait for dinner we couldn't wait to get out of there and I was to hot and exhausted from complaining about the stupid room fee to stay and complain about the awful service. I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways. Thank you Capos for making our yearly Vegas family vacation dinner memorable in a bad way.

place was awesome our rooms where clean and spacious and we were lucky enough to get a beautiful view of Las Vegas and the strip. The rooms have a full window and allows you open the drapes from wall to wall, nothing like going to sleep with a beautiful view and waking up looking at the clouds in the sky, very peaceful. The air conditioning worked wonderfully and ran at 65 degrees during my stay. The pools were great and it wasn't crowded. It is far away from the strip but it is peaceful with a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThe kids have so many options with the movies, boweling and arcade. So many choices of places to eat, food court  yard house, and lucille's. \n\nThings that need to be worked on to make this place 5 stars is the free WiFi never is in service and won't connect and you get awful cell connection.

I was pleasantly surprised.  Four of us got a killer deal of three nights plus airfare for about the same price as airfare alone.  I mentioned to a few people where we would be staying, and got the Ewww looks.  We normally stay at Harrah's due to their generous comping system, and it's always nice.  But, I figured, the hotel is just a place to crash, it just needs to be decent.\n\nIt was decent.  The rooms were clean.  Housekeeping was prompt when we requested extra amenities.  The water pressure was good and the water was hot.  \n\nSo, why only 2 stars?  1) 95% of the employees act like they hate their job and they don't care who knows it.  2) There was some draining problem in the shower and you wound up with 3 inches of water with each shower.  3) The casino only tracks table games if you play $25/hand.  I have a \"system\" in Pai Gow and vary my bets, and this rule seems unnecessarily elitist.

another one of my reviews I think you should ignore because I don't know what I'm talking about.  I don't club.  I don't get clubbing.  I don't get standing in line, fashion shows, $6 bottles of water and $13 drinks.  I'd rather go dance at a dive bar with a blues band or a cheesy DJ and drink beer.  But every now and then you have to get together with the girls, dress up and go out.  By every now and then I mean like annually.\n\nBut I have been to the VooDoo lounge twice (in three years) and had good fun both times.  The crowd is mixed, not all trendy hipsters (not that I'm against trendy hipsters, I just like variety), and fun.  I met fun people at the bar, and met some fun girls in the ladies room line.  The view is of course fabulous.  And the second time we got in the VIP section, which doesn't really seem much different than the rest of the place and not that hard to get into.

We got slightly splashed a few times, but nothing terrible. The upside was that were close enough to the half-naked Adonis-like male performers to almost reach out and touch them.   Mmmm.\n\nGlad to hear (from reading other reviews) that I'm not missing something in that I was unable to follow the storyline.  The water performance was mesmerizing... synchronized swimming, diving, and slow submersions.  The aerial performance was also fun to watch, and at times (several times), there was so much going on it was hard to decide what to pay attention to.

We ordered the Chef's Experience tasting menu for a party of 5. They allowed one person in our party to order individually due to dietary restrictions. The tasting menu is $55 and well worth it. A well paced meal starting with the gold fleck dumplings. The 2nd course was a guacamole stuffed jicama cup. The hearts of Palm salad was spicy and tasty. I honestly can't remember everything but we had duck in steamed bun taco wrapper, noodles, veggie rice, carnitas tacos,shrimp, pork stuffed wontons with sesame paste, buns with a codensed milk dipping sauce, and we ended with churros and a mango rice pudding.

I came to this Trader Joe's store in the Summerlin area, because my usual Trader Joe's store I go to that is near the Downtown Las Vegas area on S. Decatur Blvd. had shut down. Whaaaaaaat???? I was just went to this store this past April 2017! Shucks!\n\n9. This particular Trader Joe's store on W. Washington Ave. is pretty big! Waaaaaaaaaaaaay bigger than the store I use to go to on S. Decatur Blvd. I love this store, as it looks clean, and has a lot of parking.\n\n8. Did I mention to you folks about the free coffee samples that Trader Joe's provides? By the way, if you don't know..........Trader Joe's sells a pretty good coffee here! \nWhenever I stop by a Trader Joe's, I always buy a few bags of coffee. How did I know that TJ sells a good coffee? From sampling the free coffee.........Lol!\n\n7. Trader Joe's sell a lot of wonderful organic fruits & vegetables, as well as flowers.\n\n6. How can I not stop by here without picking up my favorite Butter Waffle Cookies! If you buy me a few boxes, I'll be your best friend..........Okay? Lol!\n\n5. You like candy? Shoots..........they got a lot of that here! My all time favorite is those Dark Chocolate covered Raisins! Ummmmmmmmmm!\n\n4. The Biscotti's are pretty good here, but I rather have the Chocolate \"Dunkers\" instead...........the Dunkers go good with coffee!\n\n3. You like beer or wine? They got a lot of that here!\n\n2. When I went to this Trader Joe's this past Oct. 2017,  I was pretty blown away that you could actually buy a gallon of milk for just $2.89!

I hear people always raggin' about the post office, but you know what gang? The postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! You can ship stuff all over the world, it is cheaper to use the the US Postal Servie, then any of those private shipping companies - FedEx, UPS, DHL.........etc.\n\nLast month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.\n\nWhile I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.\n\nAs a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! \nDon't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to \"travel efficiently\", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!\n\nHow does the Post Office come into play? \n\nWell, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).\n\nBut that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything \"liquid\" or \"paste\" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.\n\nCatch my drift???\n\nSo after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - \"Flat Rate\" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!\n\nWhaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!\n\nSo if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.\n\nJust an FYI..........\n\nLarge Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! \n\nMedium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!\n\nThis Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed). \nIn my case...........I shipped my box out on Sunday, and used the kiosk!

Therefore, this outlet mall probably has more stores then your average outlet mall...........\n\nIf you're not into shopping, this mall still has a purpose................ as you can walk this huge mall for exercise! \nA nice feature about the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet is that this mall is an \"indoor mall\", so in the hot summers you won't have to worry about the extreme Las Vegas heat, and in the winter you won't have to worry about the cold weather either.\n\nThere are tons of stores in this mall, as well as two food courts. Some of my favorite stores I like to check out are - Nike, Under Armour, Quiksilver, Converse, & Vans.\n\nThe list of stores at this outlet mall are pretty endless........too many stores to mention here, so I will just post a link so you can see the various stores & eateries at this outlet mall.\n\nhttp://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/las-vegas-south/stores\n\nIf for some reason you don't have a car to get to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall, no need to fret, as there is a smaller version of this outlet mall near the downtown Las Vegas area called - the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet. \n\nThe North Premium Outlet may not be as big, or have as much stores, but if you just happen to stay at a hotel in the downtown area like - the California Hotel, Fremont, Four Queens, Golden Nugget, Main Street, The D, Plaza Hotel, or Downtown Grand Hotel, the North Premium Outlet Mall is not too far away from these downtown hotels........... \n\nYou can probably take a long walk, catch a bus, or even a taxi down to the North Premium Outlet Mall, as it's not too far away.\n\nOverall, I'd rather go to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall, as I like the indoor shopping atmosphere..",21.0,4.1,6016.0,14824.0,1.0,"Las Vegas South Premium

reading all the wonderful reviews from my Yelp Buddies - da FAMOUS Auntie - Nadine C., Denise T., Gem S., Michael C., & Angel H., it was time to get reacquainted with The Buffet at the Bellagio.\n\nI came to the Bellagio to try the buffet many years ago (I think around 1998 or 1999), and haven't gone back since. \nI don't know why it took so long for me to come back here, as I remembered when I did try it back in the late 90's, it was a pretty darn good buffet, with the exception of remembering that they served very small servings of food. \nNow don't worry gang.............it's a buffet, so you can keep coming back for more! I guess the small servings are a great idea, that way you get to try the various items that the buffet would offer.\n\nIt's year 2016, and all I can say is - \"I'm Baaaaaaaaaack!!!!\" \n\nI took my pops & cousin to the Bellagio so they could enjoy the wonderful buffet at the Bellagio! The quality of food is top notch, and the offerings & selections is huge!\n\nSome of my favorites at this buffet is the Prime Rib & Mussels. \n\nThey also had Kobe Beef, Turkey, & Ham too at the carving station. If you like pasta & pizza........they had that too. They also had a station where they served Asian themed food, like won ton soup, & Char Shu. \nThen there was seafood, like the cold crab, as well as fish, & mussels.\n\nThe desserts were to die for...........if you have a sweet tooth like me, you can kill your sweet addiction by visiting this dessert buffet! There are just too many things to mention here!\n\nService by the waiter, as well as the chef at the carving station was not the friendliest, but I'm not here to experience top notch service. I was here to throw down & EAT! \n\nBut if you need to know about my service experience...........when I was seated, the table they placed us on was still dirty, as when I had put my cellular phone down on the table, there was some kind of sticky substance on the table, making my phone dirty. \nI told the waiter when he had time, if he could kindly clean up the table again........and I'm not sure if he got irritated about that? After that, while were were dining, not once did the waiter come by to check on us. When I ran out of hot tea, I had to flag down our waiter to get a refill.\n\nOn the bright side, at least the busboy was very quick to remove the dirty plates once we finished our meals, so at no time was the table left with stacked plates.\n\nFor $35.99 per person, the Buffet at the Bellagio is still a great bargain for the type of food they offer! Check 'em out gang!

of my all time favorite burger joints! They do one thing, and they do it well! A very simple menu of just burgers, fries, shakes, & soda......period!\n\nI remember the very first time I ever walked into an In-N-Out............ordered me a hamburger, ate it............then thought..........\"is that it?\" I was wondering what's the big deal? \nIt wasn't until one of my friends, who is an In-N-Out fanatic told me - \"NO\"..........anytime you go to an In-N-Out, you must always order the Double Double!!!\n\nSince that time...............whenever I'm on the mainland, and walk into a In-N-Out burger joint, I always order a Double Double! \n\nWhat can I say about the In-N-Out burger joint............\n\n1. I wished they would open one up in Hawaii.\n\n2. Food is cheap, only $3.20 for a Double Double, & very tasty too! Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp. \n\n3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!\n\n4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!\n\n5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).\n\nLots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go

don't have a Raising Cane's in Hawaii, so when I came here, I had no expectations that I would be eating some ono fried chicken!!!\n\nWhile I was driving to Trader Joe's in downtown Summerlin, I just so happen to pass a In-n-Out burger joint, so I told my pops that I wanted to stop by for a burger.\nWhen I actually got to that In-n-Out joint, I realized that the In-n-Out was a brand new restaurant, and that the restaurant had not opened yet (they were closed for a team meeting), as they were still putting the final touches to the restaurant.\n\nFrom there, I noticed a Raising Cane's restaurant next door...........being that I'm from da 808, we don't have any Raising Cane's out here, so I figured we'd drop on in to see what they had to offer.\n\nUpon walking into the joint, I was stund, as I realized this place was pretty popular..........I mean the joint was PACKED!!!!!\n\nWhile waiting in line, I looked over the wall menu, and I guess Raising Cane's is similar like a Chick-Fil-A, as they only serve chicken here..........frrrrrried chicken that is! (Which is perfect for me!).\n\nAlthough the line was long, the clerk was very efficient & moved the line quickly. Upon getting to the ordering counter, I ordered the following items -\n\n1. The Sandwich Combo ($6.28) - which consisted of a 3 Chicken Fingers,  Cane's special sauce, Lettuce, Kaiser Roll, Crinkle Cut Fries, & a Drink from the open soda fountain. \n\n2. The 3 Finger Combo ($6.47) - which consisted of 3 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Fries, Cane's special sauce, Texas Toast, & a Drink from the open soda fountain.\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nYou gotta new fan here from da 808! The fried chicken fingers was OUTSTANDING!!! \nThe chicken pieces were plump, juicy, crunchy, & did not taste oily at all! I really enjoyed how they did the chicken! To top it off, that Cane's special sauce was awesome too! Not sure what's in that special sauce, but if you told me it was crack, I'd probably believe you! Lol!\n\nWhat an unexpected pleasant experience dining here! Should I ever visit the downtown Summerlin area again, I'll be sure to stop by Raising Cane's again!\n\nTo my friends from da 808, chance 'em gang!

just wanted to update my review here at the Golden Nugget. A big MAHALO to the Golden Nugget for the comp. room! I must say, the Golden Nugget is by far the best hotel within the downtown Las Vegas area.\n\nThe accommodations were wonderful, as the room we had at the Rush Tower was very spacious, clean, and well kept. The room was all so quite too, so you don't hear any of the noises from the outside light show from the Fremont Experience.\n\nI didn't realize it, but there are a lot of restaurants and bars within this hotel property....they are -\n\n1. Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse\n2. The Chart House\n3. Grotto Ristorante\n4. Lillie's Asian Cuisine\n5. Red Sushi\n6. The Buffet\n7. Cadillac Mexican Cantina and Tequila Bar\n8. Claim Jumper Restaurant\n9. Starbucks\n10. Gold Diggers\n11. Rush Lounge\n12. Claude's Bar\n13. Ice Bar\n14. Bar 46\n15. Stage Bar\n16. H2O Bar\n17.

visiting Las Vegas I was eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet on Tuesday night with my family..........a few hours later (into the evening), one of my family members experienced projectile vomiting, & ungodly nonstop diarrhea from eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet! \n\nThe next day when it was time to eat again, there was no way that we were gonna do any buffet! \nHad to look for something to take out, and something light for my loved one, so off I went to the little Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Road.........I found this rather large Chinese restaurant called - Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant.\n\nIn I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?\n\nLucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!\n\nThis place offered seven types of juk -\n\n1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large\n2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large\n3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large\n4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large\n5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large\n6. Chicken Porridge - $12.00 for Large\n7.

ya know there is only (3) Trader Joe's stores in Las Vegas? \nIf you add in the stores from the Henderson neighborhood into the mix, then you can add (2) more stores..............\n\nEver since my beloved Trader Joe's store on Decatur Blvd. closed up last year, I decided that I'll be testing out the other Trader Joe's locations when I go to Las Vegas. \n\nSo far, I've made it out to the Trader Joe's store on W. Washington Ave., and I must say I really liked that store! \n\nThis past Thursday when I made my Trader Joe's run, I decided to venture out to the Trader Joe's store in the south Summerlin neighborhood, as the store is located on Summa Drive.\n\nWhat can I say about the Trader Joe's store on Summa Drive?\n\nAlthough the store is a wee bit further out from the downtown Las Vegas strip, getting out to the Summerlin neighborhood was totally worth it, as the Summerlin neighborhood is like visiting the - Kahala / Hawaii Kai neighborhood (for you Hawaii folks..........you know what I mean!).\n\nUpscale, and very safe neighborhood, with a lot of other strip mall businesses nearby........... \n\nThis particular Trader Joe's store appears to be a little smaller than the store on W. Washington Ave., but it has all the basic items that I was looking for.\n\nThe parking lot for the Trader Joe's is shared by other businesses, but the parking lot itself was sizable enough, so I didn't have any issues finding parking while shopping at Trader Joe's.\n\nA quick tip............which may draw us Hawaii folks to this location! While I was driving up to this Trader Joe's store, I noticed just a short block away there was an \"In-n-Out Burger\"! \nIf fact, I actually drove down to that particular In-n-Out burger joint to try & get a burger there, only to find out that the store was brand new (not opened yet), as they had a \"orientation meeting\" that day.\nMaybe next time I visit the Trader Joe's, I'll made a side trip to In-n-Out.

stayed at the Fremont Hotel & Casino a ton of times..........this is my parents all time favorite hotel. \nMy mom especially loved to stay here, due to the location.........as the hotel was centered around many other hotels, and she just loved to hotel hop to do her gambling. \n\nRooms are small, but clean..........nothing fancy at all. \n\nWhen I stay at budget hotels, all I ask for are two things.............\n\n1. That the hotel room is clean. Check!\n\n2. That the place is safe, & you will not get robbed. Check!\n\nBoyd gaming runs 3 hotels in the downtown area.........the Fremont Hotel, California Hotel, & Main Street Hotel. All three are very popular with the Hawaii crowd.\n\nBesides all the gambling & fun...........part of the Las Vegas experience is the eating too! \n\nOne of my all time favorite things I like to eat is the Fried Chicken from the Fremont Hotel's buffet.\n\nThe buffet in the Fremont hotel is not as large, but has enough section of things to choose from. \n\nLast night - it was Steak night, and I went with my dad to have dinner. I wasn't there for the steak..........I was there for only one thing..........the FRIED CHICKEN (see pic)!\n\nUmmmmm........Fried Chicken! What can I say............they know how to do it right! \nBig Meaty pieces of chicken, fried to perfection, & seasoned just right!

love this rental car facility, as it's an \"all in one\" rental car station!\n\nWhen I use to go to Las Vegas in the late 90's with my weightlifting buddy to attend the Fitness & Mr. Olympia shows, the rental car facilities consisted of separate car rental lots, and separate rental car buses to get you to the rental car facility.\n\nI forgot what year this happened in Las Vegas, so I had to Google it to see what year the McCarran Rent-a-Car facility opened, and I must commend the bright individual to had the wonderful idea to make an \"all in one\" rental-a-car center.\n\nThe McCarran Rent-a-Car Center in Las Vegas is probably one of my 1st experience using an \"all in one\" rental car facility. \nAfter looking up the McCarran Rent-a-Car Center on Google, it says that the Las Vegas facility opened up back in year 2007, with the Sacramento International Airport being the very first facility (in the U.S.) to open this type of rental car facility back in year 1998.\n\nThe McCarran Rent-a-Car Center is huge, and houses not only a lot of brands of rental car businesses, but it also houses a Starbucks coffee house, a store to buy last minute items (magazines & toiletries), and slot machines for you folks who love to gamble, and cannot wait to get to the casino! Lol!\n\nThe bus ride from the McCarran Airport to the Rent-a-Car facility is fast, (like about 7 to 10 minutes or so)...........after taking care of your paperwork for your rental, just head to the

of my favorite buffet places to eat breakfast........... The Garden Court Buffet at the Mainstreet Hotel offers a  ton of items!\n\nIt's hard to describe, but this place probably has everything under the sun for what you're looking for!\n\nFor me, what I like to eat here for breakfast is the Chicken Fried Steak! It is a meaty, breaded, fried meat patty, which you can add on the white mushroom gravy, & throw it into a biscuit! \nYeah, it maybe a little unhealthy............but so long as you don't eat it everyday...........it's all about moderation right? Add in a little scrambled egg & cut fried potatoes and we are good to go!\n\nThis buffet is so big, they offer the basic breakfast meats - bacon, ham, sausages, egg & Portuguese sausages. \nThere is also many types of fruit if you're looking for something healthy...........and they do offer the oatmeal, waffles, & pastries too.  \n\nToo many items to eat in one sitting I must say, but at least

out your rental car.\n\n- Fred, my agent was very friendly & efficient! \nGreat customer service should be recognized.......and if management from Alamo sees this review, please give Fred a RAISE! He certainly deserves it!\n\n- After signing your paperwork, all you have to do is head straight to the parking garage and pick whatever car is available in the lot, according to the type of car you

my 800th review, I like to write about something very dear to my heart - Da Automobile!\n\nI really don't understand the current generation of kids, as I see less kids going out to get their driver's license. \nAs for my generation, I was driving since I was 14, and got my driver's license when I \nwas 15 years old. \n\nTo me, having a driver's license meant potential independence once I was old enough to buy my own car, and being around cars all my life, one can't help but fall in love with the car..........which brings me to a place called - The Auto Collection in the LinQ hotel.\n\nThe LinQ hotel was formally called the Imperial Palace Hotel, but a recent renovation to this particular hotel, there has been a name change & a full restoration of this hotel.\n\nThe Auto Collection is not located in the LinQ hotel per se; the auto museum is actually attached to the LinQ parking garage on the 5th floor.\n\nCost to get into the museum is $12.95 per adult, $8.95 for seniors, $7.95 for children 12 years and under. \nChildren who are 5 years and under, can go in here for free with an adult.\n\nThe museum is opened from Monday to Saturday 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. They are closed on Sunday.\n\nTIP = If you look on-line and Google - \"The Auto Collection\" you can print out a coupon where you can buy a ticket, and get another person in for free.\n\nI actually printed out a coupon before I flew out to Las Vegas, but it doesn't help if I forgot my coupon at home..........shucks! \nAlso, they do not accept the coupon if you try to show them the coupon on your smart phone (it is stated on the free coupon ad); they do require you to physically print out the coupon to use it.\n\nThough the years, I've been to this car museum 4 times, and each time I came here the inventory of cars change, as most of these vintage & classic cars are for sale too.\n\nIf you like vintage hot rods like me, they have it here! \nYou like luxury classics, they have that too. \nAnd if you like rare & exotic cars, or cars formally owned by celebrities........you may even find that here too. \n\nWhen I came to The Auto Collection the other day, the few cars that stood out for me this time were -\n\n1. 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Fastback or \"Eleanor\", the car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". So beautiful that car, and how can you not love AMERICAN MUSCLE Cars?\n\n2. 1970 Dodge Charger R/T 440 Magnum this car was also featured in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". A black sinister looking car, with a NASTY 440 Magnum Engine to boot!\n\n3. 1963 Chevrolet Nova Memorial Race Car. This car was built in dedication for all the fallen & living US Marine solders of the Iraq war.\n\n4. 1955 Cadillac Series 75 Fleetwood Limousine. What's special about this car? It was Elvis Presley's 1st Cadillac Limo. How can you not love Elvis? Lol!\n\n5. 1939 Chrysler Royale Sedan. What's so good about this car? Well, this car belonged to the KING OF LATE NIGHT - Johnny Carson. Well, actually it was Johnny Carson's dad's car.  Johnny Carson used this car to take his date to the senior prom, and many years later when Johnny Carson became rich & famous, he tracked down his father's car, bought it, and fully restored it. In 1994, Johnny Carson sold this car to the Imperial Palace Hotel for $1.00. This car is NOT for sale by the way.\n\n6. 1971 Dodge Challenger Convertible. I'm not much of a rag top man, but I do admit I like the design, & the fine lines of the Challenger. I must tip my hat off to Dodge, as I feel they did an awesome job in the current 4th generation Challenger, which they introduced back in 2008.\n\n7. 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 Roadster. When people talk about AMERICAN Sports Cars, an easy name will come up...........the Corvette!

you folks are so lucky you live on the mainland! \n\nWhy?\n\nWell, you folks have so many choices as far as restaurants goes........being that I was born & raised on an island...........I feel the 808 has limited choices sometimes.\n\nOne of the joints that we don't have in the 808 is - \"The Habit Burger Grill\". \n\nThe Habit Burger Grill was founded in 1969 in Santa Barbara, CA., and since then, The Habit Burger Grill has expanded all over that state of California with 174 stores. \n\nIs \"The Habit Burger Grill\" stores outside of California?\n\nYes, they have Habit Burger Grill's in the following states of - Arizona, Utah, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, & Pennsylvania. \n\nOversea's? \nThey sure do, with (2) stores in the United Arab Emirates, and (2) stores in China.\n\nTotal Habit Burger stores? 243 stores my friend............(Thank you Google!).\n\nWhat can I say about my 1st experience at \"The Habit Burger Grill\", inside the Fashion Show Mall food court in Las Vegas?\n\nThe Habit Burger Grill kinda reminds me of In-n-Out Burger...........(we don't have In-n-Out's either in the 808!)\n\nThe burgers are reasonably priced, as you can get a Charburger here for just $3.89! Can we say Dealages Yo!!!!\n\nThe day we stopped by The Habit Burger Grill, we ended up getting a Charburger ($3.89), a Teriyaki Char ($4.19), & a Veggie Burger ($5.45).\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I don't do red meat..........\nAlthough the Veggie Burger had a large amount of lettuce & tomatoes, but the veggie patty was kinda bland tasting..........worst yet, since I recently had a veggie burger from another major burger joint in the 808, I had something to compare it to, and realized the Veggie Burger at The Habit Burger Grill fell a little short.\n\nAs for the Teriyaki Char, & the Charburger? \nYes, those are great burgers, as my pops & cousin really enjoyed their burgers!\n\nIf you're not into red meat like myself, there are other options as I saw they offered several types of chicken sandwiches.\n\nIf you don't wanna do a sandwich, they also offer fresh salads. \n\nHave a sweet tooth? \n\nThe Habit Burger Grill also has shakes, malts, cones, & sundaes too!\n\nI probably just ordered the wrong item............next time I come across a Habit Burger Grill...........I'll do the chicken, & update my review.

was told by a friend to give the Wicked Spoon Buffet - at the Cosmopolitan Hotel a try, so when I was in Las Vegas this past week, I decided to take my cousin, & dad to try this place...........\n\nI must say, the modern decor of this place was quite beautiful.........but as for the food I consumed, I'd give it a  solid \"3.5\". \nFor me, some of the items I ate was either a - \"hit\" or \"miss\"......... \n\nA lot of the items they serve here are in a \"small bite size portion\", perfect for the eater to just try a little of this & that.......... \n\nWhat is bad about serving a \"small individual portion\" for a buffet is that sometimes the item can go cold, therefore when you eat it, it may not be of the right temperature to consume, losing the benefit of how it was actually meant to be served.\n\nThe buffet was HUGE! Lots of different dishes............I probably didn't even get to try 2/3 of the buffet, as I was pretty full after eating two plates of food, then having a little salad on the side & deserts.\n\nA few items that I ate, which were a \"hit\" for me, and stood out  -\n\n1. Prime Rib - Not bad.............it was done right, but the meat was not of the best grade. I've had prime rib in Wisconsin where the meat was so soft, I could cut it with a fork.\n\n2. Kalbi Ribs - The Marinade was out of this world! Only bad thing was the meat was a bit tough & chewy.\n\n3. Bone Marrow - Not much to eat, but I don't know of any place that serves bone marrow. Something very unique.\n\n4. Mussels & Oysters  - This was done right.........ate a lot of it too!\n\n5. Fried Chicken drumstick - Served in a small individual basket..........chicken was done perfectly, as it was crispy and flavorful.\n\n6. Waldorf Salad - An all time 1st for me...........never had it, but I liked it. Probably cuz it had grapes in the salad, and I like grapes.\n\n7. Cheesecake & Chocolate covered Strawberry - All deserts were served \"bite size\" portions. The cheesecake was outstanding! I really loved the texture of the cheesecake. As for the chocolate covered Strawberry..........I just love strawberries, and when you dip it in chocolate...........how can you go wrong???\n\nThe service was outstanding! Our waiter was very friendly, & he was quick to remove our dirty plates after we had finished eating. \n\nLots of free parking at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

just had to come by the Hershey's Chocolate World store in the New York New York Hotel.........why? Well, I'm just a big fan of chocolate! \n\nFunny, I was hoping to see some interesting displays, or maybe even some history about Hershey's.........but little did I know, all I was visiting was a (two stories) store which sold Hershey's theme stuff, which was just a tourist trap.\n\nBasically this store sells a lot of Hershey's theme merchandise, as well as all sorts of Jolly Rancher, Hershey's, & Twizzler candies.

LOVE THIS PLACE! Open 24/7! Just like Zippy's! Lol!\n\nGeez, what does Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant remind me of? Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!\n\nApparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987! \nThey have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.\n\nAs we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. \n\nUpon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!\n\nOne of my friends also picked the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an \"Arnold Palmer?\" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......\n\nMy other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say \"Sugar Overload?\" Lol!\n\nWhat can I say about my meal?\n\nLove it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!\nThe hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!\n\nService was Excellent!

you go to Lappert's Ice Cream Shop.......what do you do? Of course you get ice cream! But a big dummy like me..........I came here to get a cup of coffee.  :(\n\nIf was a very hot afternoon (102 degrees), and I didn't feeling like walking to the Golden Nugget Hotel for Starbucks, or to the Fremont Hotel for Dunkin Donuts coffee, so I went upstairs to the Mezzanine level of the California Hotel & stopped by Lappert's Ice Cream Shop for coffee.\n\nBesides ice cream, they serve coffee here, as well as Winchell's Donuts. I've never had a Winchell's donut, but I see Winchell's all over the place in southern California.\n\nUpon walking into the shop, I decided to get a cup of coffee, but lucky for me.........they had this deal where you buy a 16 oz. cup of their gourmet coffee, you get a free Winchell's donut (wot a deal!).\n\nWell, after getting my cup of coffee............I realized the coffee really isn't too gourmet........... \n\nIn fact the coffee tasted a little burnt to me, as I think the coffee was on the heating pot for too long of a period, \nTo top if off, the free glazed donut I got was hard too! YUCK!

the biggest, or fanciest of buffets, but I gotta give the Golden Nugget Buffet an A-Okay for the cleanliness of the buffet.\n\nDon't you tired when there are a lot of people who riffle through the food at a buffet? And what is left is a big nasty mess! Well, you don't have to worry about that when you come to the Golden Nugget Buffet! I must say it's rather clean, and very well presented.\n\nI've eaten there mostly for breakfast & dinner in the past, and have always had a pretty pleasant experience. \n\nI was just here the other day for breakfast.........the breakfast buffet is not really large with a lot of selection, but what they do have is probably sufficient for you to fill your tummy. \n\nI do like that they have a carving station, and a chef that will make you fresh eggs or a fresh omelet.\n\nBesides all the nasty breakfast meats - :Link Sausage, Bacon, Portuguese Sausage, Chicken Fried Steak, Spam, etc., they do offer a healthy fare too like oatmeal, cereal, or fresh fruit.\n\nAs for me, da local boy in me gotta have his Spam! Yes, if Spam was healthy.........I swear on my deathbed that I'd eat it everyday! That's how much I love Spam!!! \n\nFor you folks (NFH) = Not From Hawaii..........Hawaii people eat the most Spam per any capita! \n\nSpam is da Hawaiian Steak Yo!!!!\n\nSee this link yourself - \nhttp://www.thehawaiiplan.com/why-do-hawaiians-love-spam/\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I didn't only eat Spam here.........I also had a fresh egg omelet with everything in it! And I must say the omelet was deeeeeeeeeeeelicious!!!!\n\nTo add some healthy junk in, I ate some grapefruit, then to ruin by healthy eating, I proceeded to eat a slice of cheesecake & bread pudding! LoL! \n\nHey man, it's all about moderation right? LoL! \n\nService here is pretty good, as the waiter or waitress is pretty attentive. They also leave you a big pot of coffee (if you're a coffee drinker), that way you won't have to keep bothering the waiter or waitress for a refill.

been a very long time since I've been here.........\n\nI think when this place first opened in the late 90's, I remembered checking this place out where they gave you free samples of Coca Cola, and you could also try the various Coca Cola soda products from all over the world. \n\nI remembered there was a fountain, where you would put your cup down, and soda would shoot across the room from a distance into your cup........I thought that was sooooooooooo cool!\n\nNow it's year 2015, and a lot has changed...........no longer are there free soda samples. You can still try the various Coca Cola soda products from all over the world, but there is a fee of $8.00 or $12.00 bucks to try them.\n\nWhile I straggled into the World of Coca Cola store..........I must say this place is a Coke collector's dream, as they sell practically everything you can think of for Coke memorabilia! \n\nAs I checked out the store that day, I did not try the various soda flavors of Coke, as I stopped drinking soda back in 2014. \nI did buy a soda for my pops, and a Dasani water for myself..........and I must say the bottled water was real cheap at

the fanciest of hotels, but the California Hotel is a local favorite for us kamaaina's! \n\nService is always excellent, and they sure know how to extend the ALOHA spirit to the 9th island!\n\nSome of the good things about this hotel is -\n\n1. Quiet - Since this hotel is away from the Fremont Light Show Experience, you don't have to deal with the hourly light show & noise.\n\n2. Clean - The California Hotel does a great job of keeping the room sparkling clean! Looks like they also have up-kept the hotel by replacing the carpet & wall paper in the hallway, as well as in the rooms.\n\n3. The room is pretty spacious, unlike the Fremont Hotel.\n\n4. They have a few useful amenities like a small fridge, flat screen t.v., hair dryer, iron & ironing board, & a little safe so you can keep your loot inside, so you don't have to carry so much money on you.\n\n5. Free self parking, but they also valet if you choose to use it.\n\n6. There are also 3 main restaurants in the Hotel/Casino area - The Redwood Bar & Grill, Market Street Cafe, & a new restaurant which recently opened called \"California Noodle House\".\n\nI had a very relaxing, & nice stay here.

been coming here every other year..........just to support the University of Hawaii Football program. As an alumni of the University of Hawaii........isn't it the right thing to do?\n\nThe Sam Boyd Stadium is not too far from the Sam Boyd's downtown hotels........I wanna say it's probably about 12 to 15 miles away, and very easy to find.\n\nA few things I like about this little stadium -\n\n- Free parking........yeah most of it is on a dirt road, but who cares? FREE PARKING! Get it?\n\n-  Food & Drinks are a little cheaper than what I would pay at the Aloha Stadium. For instance...........Beer here is just $7 bucks, where as I pay $9.50 at home.\n\nBut a bad thing about this place -\n\nThere is no individual seating........just a hard metal bench seating. The good thing is you can pack more people into this little stadium, but the bad thing is.......if the game runs long, it can be pretty hard on your butt!\n\nThis is a outdoor stadium.........and we Hawaii folks are not use to the \"cold\" in the winter time. \n\nI don't know what I was thinking when I came up here............as I was just planning on just bringing up shorts, t-shirt, & a light jacket. Lucky for me, my smart girlfriend told me that it would not be wise, and that I should wear pants & layer my shirts. Thanks Jules Y.! You da bestest & smartest gf!\n\nAnd you know what? As the sun came down..........and it turned into night.......it was quite nippy at the stadium. I see a few Hawaii bruddah's who went with shorts & t-shirts.........and I could see they were a little uncomfortable. But as for me.........I was warm as a puppy dog.......with the exception on when I left the stadium, and the winds picked up! MAN! It was so cold..........I felt like a frozen Popsicle! I had to blast that heater in the car for a little while.............but I was okay. \n\nAlthough we lost again, and took a beat down from UNLV. At least I was happy to see a lot of Hawaii people supporting the University of Hawaii Football program! \n\nThe people of Las Vegas were nice, and there was definitely good sportsmanship, as there

a bad place to go and get some late night grindages........especially when all the buffets had shut down, and you're a bit hungry from flying back from the bay area.\n\nWhile in Vegas, I made a side trip to the bay area to visit da ohana, and upon flying back to Las Vegas, it was rather late and way past dinner time.\n\nLucky for me, inside the California Hotel, there is a restaurant called the - Market Street Cafe!\n\nI've been here a few times.........mostly to get my late night grindz on. \n\nIt's a great place to visit if you're needing something to eat late at night, or something to dilute all that beer you drank from the late night outing (that was the old me), and of course, when hungry - at least this place is open 24/7! Food quality is just average, but it's edible, and cheap!\n\nThis place is known for the oxtail soup, but I felt like some steak & eggs! \n\nFor what you pay (dirt cheap) & what you get...........it's a real good bargain!

many of you are fans of Rock n' Roll????\n\nGrowing up as a kid, rock music was the thing we use to listen to, and what better way to get your kicks by checking out the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas!\n\nI've been to a few Hard Rock Restaurants, but going to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino takes it up another notch as far as checking out the Rock n' Roll memorabilia that they have on display............ it's just staggering!\n\nI saw memorabilia from the following musical artist -\n\n1. Prince\n2. Madonna\n3. Mariah Carey\n4. Jon Bon Jovi\n5. memorabilia from the Woodstock concert\n6. Stevie Ray Vaughan\n7. David Bowie\n8. Johnny Cash\n9. Jimi Hendrix\n10. Lady Gaga\n11. Chester Bennington\n12. Tupac Shakur\n13. Nickelback\n14. Journey\n15. Mick Jagger\n16. Reo Speedwagon\n17. Michael Jackson\n18. Inxs\n19. Metallica\n20. Chris Cornell\n21. Richie Sambora\n22. Steve Tyler - Aerosmith\n23. Elton John\n24. Tom Petty\n25. Pearl Jam\n26. Ringo Starr - Beatles\n27. Dave Navvaro\n28. Axl Rose\n29. Tina Turner\n30. Steve Vai\n31. Spice Girls\n32. Sex Pistols\n33. Phil Collen\n34. Annie Lennox\n\nThe only disappointing thing about the rock n' roll memorabilia display is not seeing any AC/DC, or Led Zeppelin memorabilia, as they are my two favorite rock n' roll bands.\n\nDo you folks remember the former artist known as Prince? \nHow can you not forget his solo guitar performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame back in 2004? \nCheck out this clip..........\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SFNW5F8K9Y\n\nRIP - Prince, as well as Tom Petty...........\n\nLots to see at the Hard Rock Hotel...........if you're a big fan of Rock n' Roll, I

a cool display!!! \n\nWhile I was walking through the Bellagio Hotel I came across an art display from Richard Macdonald.\n\nThe display was situated by the Cirque Du Soleil theater area, and the exhibit featured metal sculptures of figures of the human form.\n\nI guess sculptures are related to the Cirque Du Soleil  show, therefore the wonderful art display.\n\nI thought this display was quite amazing & very interesting. I can see a lot of painstaking work was done to make the various figurine sculptures.\n\nIf you ever have the chance to swing by the Treasure Island hotel, you should take a peek at this wonder art display!",12.0,4.1,6016.0,14824.0,1.0,"The Art of Richard Macdonald",5.0,["what","a","cool","display!!!","\n\nwhile","i","was","walking","through","the","bellagio","hotel","i","came","across","an","art","display","from","richard","macdonald.\n\nthe","display","was","situated","by","the","cirque","du","soleil","theater","area,","and","the","exhibit","featured","metal","sculptures","of","figures","of","the","human","form.\n\ni","guess","sculptures","are","related","to","the","cirque","du","soleil","show,","therefore","the","wonderful","art","display.\n\ni","thought","this","display","was","quite","amazing","&","very","interesting.","i","can","see","a","lot","of","painstaking","work","was","done","to","make","the","various","figurine","sculptures.\n\nif","you","ever","have","the","chance","to","swing","by","the","treasure","island","hotel,","you","should","take","a","peek","at","this","wonder","art","display!"],[0,100000,[2012,2694,3223,4543,5780,5833,6756,7515,9362,9579,10109,12148,13525,13970,14035,14486,15234,15695,18333,19759,20855,21558,23921,24199,24841,26150,28995,29258,29665,31425,35710,36664,36999,39527,41998,44505,44898,45735,47752,48562,51299,52729,53138,55058,55329,56877,57862,58388,60185,61248,62707,62922,63203,63981,64449,65748,66526,68597,73170,73944,74343,75916,78892,80818,81310,83200,85373,85594,86165,90050,93255,93652,94290,96556,98050],[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,100000,[2012,2694,3223,4543,5780,5833,6756,7515,9362,9579,10109,12148,13525,13970,14035,14486,15234,15695,18333,19759,20855,21558,23921,24199,24841,26150,28995,29258,29665,31425,35710,36664,36999,39527,41998,44505,44898,45735,47752,48562,51299,52729,53138,55058,55329,56877,57862,58388,60185,61248,62707,62922,63203,63981,64449,65748,66526,68597,73170,73944,74343,75916,78892,80818,81310,83200,85373,85594,86165,90050,93255,93652,94290,96556,98050],[7.009186549085803,9.772712014097843,3.736279653504533,3.150331759564356,2.092220008296622,1.8318348348736617,1.0741658012583344,2.5378495488391954,4.559889637255463,6.096378119047523,6.2871606180459,9.523148899749673,2.253509364999693,7.174601671190991,3.8141110020658417,7.483603145660366,2.0739344501474593,7.440899443014992,0.11421416375272886,5.855714525313149,2.4548044661986483,4.080093992870198,1.487691862550222,6.168841647975059,10.264472935658844,6.417801371111454,3.727414421499627,2.827104816197893,2.88598467973577,2.0084493841390265,0.9825356429867381,16.931171705013114,5.050587365429777,2.8558305269240685,6.876379636678435,3.158531903325994,5.294600028894198,2.7876312226412137,1.5634214575213004,2.962378591759904,0.909233252417931,6.311003238170725,1.0751514926056178,7.954618193373521,1.0063275277977983,13.924595817360835,6.368108366860022,0.8725354759562478,3.711628369925795,10.147166885463447,3.208767645072293,9.818357521587803,11.892825479454135,5.646890826877712,17.740343000479143,9.450210176486834,1.7296320922922113,3.903659803707073,0.7485543033985256,1.220231232875605,1.4934794319161142,12.993215573175748,9.796617534951398,5.957801336301758,4.009538759654293,15.9139926376968,1.403933049922454,2.5279653232030723,6.708879655923964,6.909536729913225,3.1610979323610895,7.056818635534608,4.663114583137533,5.868964627151226,6.305582725555689]]],[8.0,5.0,0.0,"I love my Ba Ba Barbeque Baby! And after going to the U.H. Warrior Football game.......what better way to end the evening then to eat some Ba Ba Barbeque!!!!\n\nMy friend suggested this place called - \"Rollin Smoke Barbeque\" so we flipped on our GPS and headed to the back roads to a seedy part of town (where there were a lot of strip clubs, bars, & adult book stores).........but then when we finally found this place and walked in............ I was in Ba Ba Barbeque heaven!!!!\n\nThe restaurant was really packed, and as we walked to the counter, the friendly clerk took our orders. After you order your food, you find an open table (good luck), and when your food is ready, they will bring your order out to you.\n\nThere is a Sauce station within the restaurant where you can get additional BBQ sauce. I want to point out.........try the \"Mama Sweet\" BBQ sauce! It was bomb @ss good! My friend liked this BBQ sauce so much, I actually saw him put it in a little cup & drink the sauce! That's how much he loved the BBQ sauce!\n\nBefore you sit down at your table, you will also have to get your own plastic eating utensils, napkins, as well as your own drinks, as the soda fountain within the restaurant was self serve.\n\nFor my meal that night, I ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\" - where I picked the following - Brisket, 1/4 Chicken, & 2 Spare Ribs. ($17.99)\n\nOne of my friends also ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\"  - where he picked the Brisket, 2 Spare Ribs, & Hot Links. ($17.99)\n\nAnd my other friend ordered the \"Duo Choice Of 2 Meats\" - where he picked the Brisket, & Pulled Pork. ($13.99)\n\nWith our meals came with a side, and I ended up taking the corn bread. All of our meals came with collard greens, and the collard greens had some kind of smoked meat mixed inside.\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI totally loved the BBQ Chicken! The chicken meat was all so soft, and the meal literally fell off the bone.......nice smokey flavor too! \nThe spare ribs was also delicious, and I just loved how the meat came off of the bone so easily! I really loved how soft the BBQ ribs were....... \nAs for the brisket.........it was just okay for me. Loved the smokey flavor, but I gotta tell you the brisket wasn't very soft. I've had better tasting brisket on Oahu.......from \"Verde\" in Kaimuki.\n\nOverall a pretty good barbeque joint! No frills..........kinda of place, and they definitely churn out some pretty great barbeque meats! \n\nBe careful of your surroundings when coming here........if I was with my girlfriend, I'd probably

been here several times when I'm in Las Vegas............ I mostly come here, because my mom & dad like some of the herbs that this store sells.\n\nThis store is your typical basic \"eastern alternative medicine store\"..........herbs they sell here are no different than any other eastern medicine stores. Herbs which Asian people have been using for 100's of years...........\n\nOne of the items that my dad likes to buy is the pre-made \"herbal soup mix\". He likes it because all the ingredients are already mixed into one bag, so he doesn't have to look for all the items separately to make the soup. Real cheap, and very easy to use too............\n\nAnother item he likes to get is the medicinal plaster, & oils to use for his sometimes sore back.\n\nThe staff mostly speak Vietnamese & Chinese.......not the friendliest, but hey............ what do you expect from \"FOB\" people.......Lol!!!

so many bad reviews from Dollar Rental Car, I kinda feel fortunate that my experience while renting a car from Dollar was pretty much okay.\n\nI basically booked a economy car on-line for $24.79 per day, and upon arriving in Las Vegas I was able to walk right up to the line & visit a customer service representative right away with no wait. \nAfter doing the paperwork, and buying the (LDW - Loss Damage Waiver) for my rental, I was off to the parking lot to pick up my car.\n\nAs I headed off to the parking lot to pick up my rental car, a lot attendant told me I could pick any car from \"Zone 5\". \nWhen I got to \"Zone 5\" there were only two (2) cars left in Zone 5, and guess what? Both cars were already taken, so I thought to myself.............they told me to go to Zone 5 to get a car...........what car????? Lol!\n\nSo I walked back to the Dollar parking lot booth to tell the lot attendant that there wasn't anymore cars. From there, the lot attendant tells me to go to \"Zone 3\" to get a car..........this worked out for me, as I actually got an upgraded car from Zone 3.\n\nEverything else from there went smoothly for my rental car............on issues here.\n\nReturning my rental car went smoothly too, as the processed me quickly, and all I had to do was just show the rental car clerk that I had purchased gas with a gas receipt when I returned my car.\n\nOverall, it was just an okay experience.................if I had anything bad to say about Dollar Rental Car, I would say that they are kinda expensive! \n\nAlthough I got a great rate on my rental car ($24.79 per day), with the insurance (LDW -  at $80.64) they charged me, and I saw something they charged me on the bill called - \"Premium Road Service\" for an additional $8.99 per day (I don't remember asking for that). \n\nYou add in the various taxes you have to pay at the airport, my grand total ended up at $243.90 for just 3 days use of a rental car.\n\nNot sure if that was a good deal, but on the bright side, I didn't have to wait very long in line to do the paperwork for my rental car, I got a car upgrade, & the car was basically

been a very long time since I stayed at the Main Street Hotel. I remembered when they had remodeled the place, and I had stayed here and had a pleasant experience.\n\nNow it's 2015............and I'm back! Had to find a hotel to stay at as I went to the UNLV vs. the University of Hawaii Football game this past weekend.\n\nWhat can I say about the place? Well I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the room was, and it was also very clean. \nThe room had all the basic stuff - hair dryer, flat screen t.v., refrigerator, & ironing board and iron.\n\nAgain, the best thing about this place..........it was very clean! (Did I mention that? Lol!) \n\nSo why the \"3\" rating instead of \"4\" or \"5\"? Well, after having a wonderful stay at the Main Street Hotel.........as I was checking out, I received the rudest treatment from this older Asian lady that was handling the customers at the reception counter. \n\nWhen I was about to check out of the hotel to leave Las Vegas, I noticed there was a bit of a line......... \nI figured, no big deal........I'll just wait. But then I realized this lady was very slow........then I hear her bark out - \"anyone checking out\" please come forward.\n\nAs I waited for my turn, when I finally get to the counter, this lady rudely told me - \"Didn't you hear me? I said people who were checking out to come here 1st as they were a priority.\" \n\nI then replied back to her, without trying to be rude..........but I basically told her - \"Yes, I did hear you...........but hey, everyone else is waiting in line, and the last thing I need to do is cut in front of someone, only to make somebody mad!\"\n\nShe then didn't say anything to me........but as I looked over at the long line, everyone who heard me, and was waiting in line gave me the - \"You're right, and your an okay dude - nod!\"\n\nIf she was so concerned about the long line, she could have either done the following......\n\n1. Work faster.\n\n2. Call someone from the back to assist her, because obviously she wasn't getting it done.\n\nThis lady also needs to refresh her customer service skills..........\n\nYeah, the hotel was cheap..........I

I was in Las Vegas two weeks ago, on my way home, I caught an early Hawaiian Airlines flight. \nRushing out of my hotel, & returning the rental car, I did not have anytime to eat anything in the wee morning hours........\n\nLucky for me, the McCarran Airport's new Terminal 3 has a whole bunch of places to eat & shop,.........they even have slot machines, so you can do some last minute gambling! Lol!!!\n\nAfter checking in at Hawaiian Airlines, passing the TSA screening area, catching the monorail to Terminal 3.........it was time to sit down, relax, & get something to eat before I board my flight home.\n\nAfter walking around Terminal 3, I found this place called Baja Fresh \"Express\" Mexican Grill. It was a good place I could grab something quick..........food was edible, but of course nothing like I would get at a restaurant. But the convenience factor was spot on!\n\nOrdered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's & two soda's.............aaaah, breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know, the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor, and probably the vendor's high rent, & taxes.\n\nThe food......well, the breakfast burrito was quite BIG, it was loaded with eggs, potatoes, & one type of meat. I ended up taking bacon for my meat. Everything about the breakfast burrito was okay, with the exception of the bacon which was kinda soggy & rubbery.

took my pops to Las Vegas for the Memorial Day weekend, and while I was surfing the internet to look for a deal on a rental car, I came across the the best rate on Thrifty Rental Car.\nGang, BIG MISTAKE for renting over here! \n\nThis is what happened to me.......... \n\n1. Although I landed on time in Las Vegas, when I finally get to the rental car depot station, I ended up waiting in an extremely long line which took me over an 1 hour 30 minutes, until it got to my turn to the customer counter.\n\n2, Normally if I knew I was gonna get this type of service......... I would have just bailed out of the line, and head straight to the Avis Rental Car booth, but since I made a reservation with Thrifty, and they already charged a $100.00 to my credit card, I was locked in, so they had me by the Ba*ls!\n\n3. On my rental car confirmation voucher, after charging my credit card a $100.00, it stated that the balance payable at the counter was $57.80. This is for a rental car for 3 days & a few hours.\n\nThis is what I ended up paying for the 3 days & a few hours......... $266.78....wtf?\n\nIf you're gonna bend me over like that..........please at least use some \"lube\" on me, because I butt still hurts!!!!!\n\nUpon looking at my bill, I asked for the LDW (Loss Damage Waiver) because you never know when you could possibly get into an accident, and I see the charge of $102.80!\n\nSo to sum it up my experience........I really didn't get a great deal, and should have used Avis.\n\nI waited forever in an endless line, where all I heard was

Ummmmmmmm, what a right way to start your day! Yay!\n\nI was waiting at catch a flight out to San Jose when I decided to get something to eat from a burrito joint within the McCarran airport. \nThe burrito joint sold food & coffee, but the funny thing about the burrito joint, they don't make coffee (I'm glad). They sold me the cup for coffee, and told me I had to go across the way to a place called Einstein Bros. Bagel to get my coffee.\n\nLucky for me.........I think the burrito joint did me a big favor, as I've never had Einstein Bros. coffee before. \nI must say the coffee was rich & flavorful!

happens when you go on vacation, and you forget your smart phone or camera? \nDo you panic? Do you cry? Do you feel helpless? \n\nOr are you like me.........\"Don't worry.......be happy!\" :)\n\nSo......... I went on a short vacation to the mainland, and since United Airlines canceled my flight to San Francisco/Las Vegas, and rerouted me through Los Angeles/Las Vegas, everything was turned upside down for me.\n\nIt all started the night before I left, as I had to go to the gym to get one last workout, and upon getting home, I had to pack for my trip.\n\nQuick tip for your folks (be smart, don't be like me)..........it's NOT a good idea to pack the day before you leave, but what cha' gonna do if you gotta work? \nNext time I think I will skip out on my nighttime workout, and stay home and pack my bags instead.\n\nAnyways, I finally get to bed around 1:45 am, and told my friend to swing by my house at 7:15 am, as I had to be at the airport at around 7:30 am. \n\nI went to bed, and next thing you know..........I wake up at 7:45 am! As soon as I woke up and realized I should be at the airport, panic set in, and the mayhem began! \nI ran out the house with just my shorts on, just to see if my friend was waiting for me downstairs by the gate. \nSure enough, he was there..........steady like Freddy!\n\nI ran back into my house, threw on a shirt, slipped on my shoes, and gang,........I kid you not.........I didn't even brush my teeth, or comb my hair. I just grabbed my wallet, and out the door I went, only to realize when my friend was driving me to the airport, that I had forgotten my phone! YIKES! Ouch!\n\nWell, I must say..........it's good to be unplugged for a few days. No need to answer to anyone, and if someone calls me while I'm on vacation........well, they will just have to wait till I get back home.\n\nAfter a few days on the mainland, I was having YELP withdrawals........I mean, without a phone, how can I Yelp?????\n\nThis is where Walmart comes to my rescue!!!! \n\nI tried going to Frys Electronics to look for a cheap camera.........but the cameras weren't dirt cheap enough, so I headed out to good 'ol Walmart instead.\n\nSure enough..........I found a cheap @ss camera (Jazz Camera) for $27.00 smackers, & a $10 SD memory card........Yay! Now I'm back in action again!!!!\n\nWell, if you see some of the pics I took on my trip...........you can clearly see what a $27.00 camera can do (which is not much), that is why some of the pics are pretty blurry. \n\nBut oh well, better than nothing yeah? I won't feel bad if this camera gets lost, or breaks..........because I consider this a \"throw away\" camera.\n\nI'm glad where ever you go........there is usually a Walmart around in the neighborhood, as they sell almost everything, and anything. \n\nBut the best part about going to Walmart, is that you can get a certain item like a digital camera real cheap!

a unique treat! Is it shave ice? Is it ice cream? Well, to be honest.......it's neither! It's rather hard to describe this unique dessert........but the best way to describe it, I would say it's like a gurl gurl (the same kinda stuff I got on Maui), but Kuma Snow Cream offers more flavors, & toppings.\n\nAfter eating that puny lobster sandwich from Lobster Me, I was still pretty hungry so my friends mentioned that we go to this place called Kuma Snow Cream. I guess my friend's daughter had turned him onto this treat, so my friend suggested we go here to try it.\n\nWhere is Kuma Snow Cream located? Just get on Spring Mountain Road, and head to the Chinatown area of Las Vegas. It's pretty easy to find, as it's not too far from the Las Vegas strip.\n\nAs we walked into the shop, I noticed a lot of bright colored toppings, as well as flavors. \n\nUpon scanning the menu, I decided to order a dessert called - \"Boo Boo's Taro\". What is in the Boo Boo's Taro? Well, it is a snow cream Taro, topped with Lychee, Gummy Bears, Popping Pearls, & a Mango Sauce.\n\nMy two friends order the following -\n\nBruce Tea - which was snow cream Green Tea, topped with Mochi, Red Bean, Popping Pearls, & Condensed Milk.\n\nBanana Bomb - which was snow cream Banana, topped with Strawberry Pearl, Almonds, Whipped Cream, & Chocolate Sauce.\n\nWhat can I say about my dessert?\n\nLoved it! The taro snow cream had the texture and consistency like the gurl gurl that I had on Maui. Only difference is the added toppings. I love Lychee! The Popping Pearls was unique too, as when you bit into it, it would \"pop\" out some liquid. Only thing I didn't care for was the Gummy Bears on top of my dessert, as when the Gummy Bears got cold.........it was rather hard to chew on my Gummy Bears.\n\nOverall, a very cool treat! I would be back again to try more flavors. They have 3 available sizes of cups, and they are -\n\n1. Mini (The smallest serving, which looked like a pretty big serving to me) $5.00\n2. Ninja (The medium serving) $6.00\n3. Sumo (The Biggest serving) $7.50\n\nCheck 'em out gang!

the smartest thing you can do for your stomach is give it a rest from all that buffet action In Las Vegas. That's where Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant comes into play.........\n\nLooking for something light???? May I suggest the shrimp/pork won ton mein over here. \nUmmmmm, a very light broth, with a few won ton dumplings, Chinese choi sum, & a very thin noodle. Just the right thing to keep you going, especially since I've been up for almost two days straight (man, am I tired!).\n\nLooks like this small restaurant has a little take out \"to go\" section, and they even make their own roast pork, and roast duck.\n\nI can see that Sam Woo's has won many awards in the past.

place is Eggcellent! \n\nAfter reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.\n\nApparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.\n\nThis location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place. \n\nWhen we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!\n\nUpon scanning the menu, I decided to get the \"Sundance Special\", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........\n\nOne of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.\n\nWith my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!\n\nOverall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry.

when you get up at 5 am to catch a flight out to the bay area.......most times you won't have a chance to grab a bite to eat your hotel.\nThis is where airport food comes into play.........\n\nGang, when you deal with airport food.......you know very well you will be rolling the dice! \n\nFirst hand...........the food will be expensive, and usually it's lousy! But hey, you have the option of not buying it.........it's either expensive lousy food, or you can eat air! \n\nFor me, I like expensive lousy airport food when you're hungry. In fact, I've eaten my share of airport food though the years...........as my job had taken me all over the U.S., so I've sort of gotten accustomed to expensive lousy airport food.\n\nWhile I was waiting to catch my flight to San Jose the other day, I spotted a joint called - \"360 Gourmet Burrito\".\n\nWhat can I say, two words which caught my eye.........\n\n1.

Burrito - I love Mexican food, so burrito.........especially a breakfast burrito sounded good to me.\n\nAnd what did I get gang?\n\nI got an EXPENSIVE LOUSY burrito! Lol! \n\nAll kidding aside..........it was maybe a 1/2 star above a lousy burrito! Good for at least a 3 1/2 star rating.\nAt best, the food was just average.........but this place was a lot better than the other airport dumps I've been to in Las Vegas like - Auntie Anne's, or Baja Fresh!\n\nFor $15.00 bucks, I got a burrito, & two cups of coffee. \n\nI must say.........the coffee was really good,..........only because this place did not make coffee. They sell you the cup, and you go across the way to another business called Einstein's Bros. Bagel to get your coffee. \n\nAnd I gotta say.......MAN! They make some really good coffee! I'm impressed, as it's in the airport too!",4.0,4.1,6016.0,14824.0,1.0,"360 Gourmet

been to the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio Hotel a few times, and I can't believe I didn't write a review of this wonderful dessert shop!\n\nLooking for a decadent treat? The Jean Philippe Patisserie is the place to be! They have an array of sweet treats that will satisfy any sweet tooth fan. Not only are the treats very pleasant to look at, they are also deeeeeeeelicious!\n\nThey sell crepes, fresh salads, delicious cakes, pastries, paninis sandwiches, & gelato. They also sell drinks like coffee, tea, hot cocoa, & soft drinks. \nLooking for a gift for a friend or loved one? They got that too, as they have pre-packaged gifts.\n\nOn the day I had came to Jean Philippe Patisserie, I had to exercise some real restraint, as the sweet treats served here are so amazing! But since I had some sweet treats earlier at breakfast, I had to pass on the sweet treats served here, and just get a cup of hot coffee.\n\nI must say the coffee that they serve at Jean Philippe Patisserie is very rich & flavorful, and can easily rival any Starbucks, Peets, Philz, Seattle's Best, or any other designer coffee joint.\n\nThe shop is very bright looking & clean. At times this store can get really busy with long lines, but lucky for me on the day I came here, it wasn't overly busy, so I was able to get my coffee & was in and out in no time.\n\nThere is no seating inside this shop, but just outside of the shop, there are lot of tables & comfortable chairs (inside the hotel) to sit & eat.\n\nLooking for a sweet treat, or a nice hot cup of coffee?

I sure miss having a 99 Ranch Market in Hawaii! \n\nLucky for me, while I was visiting Las Vegas recently, I decided to drop by a 99 Ranch Market in Chinatown.\n\nWhy did I come here in the first place? It wasn't like I was gonna cook some food. \n\nThis may sound weird to you folks, but maybe I'm a weird guy. I actually came to the 99 Ranch Market to buy some plums! Hey man, do ya know what they charge for the price per pound for plums in Hawaii? It's outrageous!!!\n\nI ended up buying a bag of Red Plums, and I gotta tell you folks............the plums were so sweet, it was just like I was eating candy!!! Ummmmmmmmmm!\n\nFunny, my friends who live on the mainland look at plums like the same way us locals from da 808 look at Mango's, Papaya's, Lychee, or Pineapple..........no big deal right?

reading my Yelp buddies - Yolanda R. & Angel H.'s review about \"Lobster Me\"..........I quickly booked marked this place, as I knew the next time I was in Las Vegas, I really wanted to try a lobster sandwich roll.\n\nYeah, I know.........the sandwich has mayonnaise, and for you folks that know me..........I am a totally mayonnaise hater! But hey, we are talkin' about lobster here, and not a tuna sandwich! But wait........I do like tuna sandwiches......yeah, I'm kinda weird.......I know! Go figure?\n\nSo after landing in Las Vegas, I tell my homies - \"'Eh, lets go to this place called \"Lobster Me\" for a lobster sandwich........I'm buying!\" \n\nSo off we went to the Venetian Hotel, and headed straight to the Grand Canal Shoppes where I quickly found this little food stand.\n\nLobster Me is located by a small food court within the Grand Canal Shoppes, the restaurant is basically a fast food lobster sandwich joint. You walk up to the counter, order your food & pay. They will give you a ticket number, then you will need to find an open table to sit down. \nWhen your food is ready, someone will bring it to your table.\n\nWhat did we order here?\n.\nOne of my friends & I ordered - The \"Original Main Style\" lobster roll which consisted of - Maine lobster meat with celery, chives and mayo. ($18.00 per combo).\n\nAnd my other friend ordered - The \"Beltway\" lobster roll which consisted of - Warm Maine lobster tossed with Old Bay and shallot-chive mayo. Topped with butter-toasted panko crumbs. ($18.00)\n\nMy friends also ordered an Old Fashion Lemonade ($4.00) & a Blueberry Lemonade ($8.00).\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI must say my lobster roll was DELICIOUS! Lot of chunks of lobster, and the seasonings with the lobster made it buttery good!\n \nBut if I could properly critique this meal, what I was really disappointed of.......... was the very small portions of food that they served, in comparison to what they charged you.\n\nThe lobster sandwich was delicious, but all so small. Funny when I see the picture on the wall menu, they make it look so big, then when you get your sandwich.............I'm thinking - \"Where's the rest of my lobster sandwich!\" Lol! \n\nAs for the sides - (potato) chips & coleslaw..........the chips, I can pass on. I'm not sure if it was freshly cut & fried, but it was definitely not light tasting at all.........kinda soggy, if anything. The coleslaw serving was ridiculously small........it was just a pinch of coleslaw, about the size of a nut...........but of course, we are not here for the sides. We are here for the lobster roll!\n\nDrinks were kind of on the expensive side...........$8 bucks for a blueberry lemonade? I'd rather drink a beer!

The service is wonderfully attentive. The focal point is definitely the bar, where all your finely crafted cocktails come to bear. Seriously, this is what you're here for so order from the cocktail menu and try out some flavours you wouldn't shake together at home!\n\nThe Not-so-Good: There's a humble assortment of hors d'oeuvres which could use a lot of work- I ordered the hummus (VERY bland) and Gouda Medley (not worth it for the price). Alas, this is a speakeasy...so it would be unfair to weigh my review too heavily on their plates. It is also quite loud in here, which is surprising given how exclusive Betty Lou's is hyped up to be. My friends and I were literally yelling our conversation to one another!\n\nAll in all, I wouldnt recommend Betty Lou's for an intimate gathering as it is rather loud inside. However, this is certainly a great place to get dressed up for a fun night of fancy drinks with girlfriends.

I usually get a regular pedi and a gel mani. This shop just happened to be convenient and on my way home. As he started to polish my toes it seemed to be dried out or almost empty. He added some liquid to thin it out. My toes look horrible....my nails look streaky and I have extra polish on my toes!! My gel mani is nothing like I asked for. I asked him to just barely trim my nails down and keep them square shaped.

The fish cuts were VERY thick and juicy. It was quite hard to stop myself from eating more haha! The chefs inside were very kind and friendly.

If you're looking for a quick, tasty and enjoyable dining experience, hit Hanlon's up!",4.0,4.23,1.0,68.0,1.0,"Hanlon's Cafe",4.5,["great,","local","diner","near","my","work,","i","often","go","there","for","lunch.","hanlon's","is","not","a","fancy","place,","but","the","food","is","good","and","fresh,","and","won't","break","your","wallet.","plus,","the","service","is","fast","and","super","friendly.","can't","beat","all","that!","my","favorite,","go-to","menu","items","include","the","amazing,","cheesy","and","not-too-salty","french","onion","soup,","the","sharable","tuna","and","patty","melts","and","the","burgers,","the","duquesne","is","my","usual,","but","i","don't","think","you'd","go","wrong","with","any","of","'em.","if","you're","looking","for","a","quick,","tasty","and","enjoyable","dining","experience,","hit","hanlon's","up!"],[0,100000,[2732,3608,3659,4426,5088,7979,10421,12301,12733,13810,18077,18333,18873,19775,22569,23281,23731,24320,25099,28314,28653,29018,30287,32315,35374,35710,36753,42956,47650,48875,49362,49553,50569,50807,51263,51499,51564,53116,53118,53744,54609,55329,55396,59884,60478,60868,61036,62490,64048,64083,64981,66214,66370,67569,67831,68401,69248,73170,74343,75893,75974,79263,82659,83603,84170,84437,86168,86502,88968,89916,90091,93401,97304],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]],[0,100000,[2732,3608,3659,4426,5088,7979,10421,12301,12733,13810,18077,18333,18873,19775,22569,23281,23731,24320,25099,28314,28653,29018,30287,32315,35374,35710,36753,42956,47650,48875,49362,49553,50569,50807,51263,51499,51564,53116,53118,53744,54609,55329,55396,59884,60478,60868,61036,62490,64048,64083,64981,66214,66370,67569,67831,68401,69248,73170,74343,75893,75974,79263,82659,83603,84170,84437,86168,86502,88968,89916,90091,93401,97304],[2.937984733413149,3.79472369154643,6.973735682299843,1.9528490180772828,5.874910389743607,5.90726901860515,4.897074003417103,3.347256120741303,4.875538397528742,5.01905394584908,3.299556886966092,0.799499146269102,5.5446720307098865,4.580484504644675,4.9725277597933335,2.106840610924825,2.7095941914669286,8.684653913108423,5.526619355980693,5.869599984826012,1.3234666835769762,0.9860011217748753,5.0040981294923865,2.78501578913092,3.74676996571943,0.6550237619911587,1.5657582212673473,5.809576833045364,0.7548529816235515,7.031956660593082,3.745325647718448,9.477186764185037,5.648672753526563,5.86053154075346,1.8264084205569446,3.348570676119588,2.5647063381889126,5.249384054208253,10.392501410086137,6.537384339613014,4.144543456860447,0.6708850185318656,6.389345451742772,4.630634121562738,3.867142788404275,4.206152276133924,1.0118565973968983,7.550432130419477,3.802635996834262,1.5881500367869923,5.200086711554014,5.342864313600065,3.6768992745819777,5.679943496331209,1.4565362682517116,4.198205532195338,2.6709128158872426,0.49903620226568374,0.4978264773053714,4.68764634013428,3.443842969146202,3.5758670493504097,2.7838098522891843,3.7929030567451654,1.3676164759932707,20.105101818177197,1.406021919814832,3.540222746187309,1.400616813746069,2.1470466337461556,2.377712491194256,5.379657175382746,4.795254486248042]]],[2.0,0.0,0.0,"It's so nice to have a Cuban place in Lawrenceville! I stopped in last week to order to-go and have a glass of wine while I waited. There were three other 2-top tables, a guy working the bar and the tables, as well as one cook in the kitchen. I ordered Empanadas appetizer, Cuban Sandwich, the Lechon Entree and Black Bean soup. I will say the Empanda is the tastiest I've ever had with a flakey, buttery crust...and that is saying a lot. The Cuban sandwich is by far one of the best in The Burgh, and the Lechon...mouth, dribble, watering. My only critiques...it took 45 minutes for my order, with three 2-tops, an already prepared meat (lechon) and a basic sandwich, seemed like a very long wait. Some better expediting in the kitchen would do wonders, as well as working on multiple orders at once. Also, I'd like to see an updated menu posted somewhere, anywhere, with the right perspective (check out their FB page). I would've given 5 stars, save for the very long wait.

is a pleasant addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood, with a wonderful atmosphere reminiscent of a Parisian cafe. And the food is fresh and tasty! Their menu offers salads, sandwiches and crepes, which are moist and light, and filled with sweet or savory choices. The salad dressings are homemade, and fantastic. The service is always friendly, and I dig that they have an exhibition kitchen.

I live in the neighborhood, and frequent this place often. The food is reminiscent of the ten years I spent in Southern California. No where else in this city will you get pork belly tacos and tamales that melt in your mouth. The ceviche is quite good, the guacamole rocks, and the brie and caramelized onion quesadilla is always a hit. Their margaritas are made with fresh juice, no gross mix! They're fantastic! \n\nCantina is not full of suburbanites or Shady-siders. it's a hip, cool, young, creative-class kind of scene, that isn't bothered by a crowded atmosphere. I've never once had a problem with the service, the bartenders are super friendly and fun. This place gets packed, so if you want a table in the back, get there early, or you will wait. But who cares, it's a great place to people watch, and the tunes on the jukebox spin with the likes of Metric, Phoenix, Passion Pit, Peter Gabriel and Tito Peunte, a very eclectic selection indeed,

I've dined at the bar, the exhibition kitchen and the communal tables and have enjoyed myself every time. Plate presentation is big here and the food flavors stand out. It is a place for adventurous eaters, self proclaimed foodies and those looking for something new and exciting.\n\nWhen I was last at Salt, I tried the Rye cocktail, made with Sazerac, cinnamon and Averna, a most tasty beverage indeed.  And the Malbec is just wonderful with dinner.\n\nMy hands down favorite starter is the beet salad, red and gold beets with frisée, truffle-mustard, and poached egg. The best way to eat it is mix it all up together, then hide it from your friends. The octopus starter is one of  of the best I've had, on both coasts, tender not chewy and nicely flavored. The scallops are cooked perfectly, plated nicely and delicious. And if you really want a treat, try the Sweetbreads. Sometimes they have veal and other times they have lamb, so ask before you order if you are concerned. I personally like the lamb sweetbreads.\n\nI've enjoyed the Hanger Steak with homemade mole sauce, although last I was there, the prep has changed to bourbon dashi and soba. My friend was kind enough to let me try a bite, and it was just as fantastic. I tried the Duck, a savory dish with livers throughout the curry roasted potatoes that were wonderful, surprising treats.\n\nTry to get both desserts, the cheese and the chocolate, they are both delectable and the presentation is top-notch.

best sushi bar in The Burgh. I lived in Southern California for ten years, and this place is better than some sushi restaurants out there.

He also asked if I had a manual, which I didn't but found one online and emailed it to him. I also gave him 100 dollars for parts. They ended up charging me for 20hrs and 210 for parts for wiring, ignition, rectifier, relay, carb float gaskets, even though I said I didn't want to spend much. They only were going to charge me 450 total as the bike has been there for around 6 months. I tried to pick up the 3 occasions, each time waiting on average an hour for someone to show up after I set up the time. 1st time they didn't have change or an invoice. 2nd time the bike was leaking fuel profusely so it was unridable. 3rd time I finally was going to take the bike regardless of condition. I ended up paying 370 for everything for it after he threatened to sue me, but agreed to 270 additional and gave me 2 weeks to pay the extra or the warranty they offer was void. They also broke the key cover for the gas tank and lost the original key that would fit to get into the gas tank and for the saddle bags, luckily I had a spare.\n\nI would not recommend any business ran by Ray or anyone associated with him.

I say this without having ever ended my contract with them, so stay tuned. That may be my next review topic.\n - As a newer gym, it's still in fairly decent shape. There's still the 3 or 4 malfunctioning treadmills lying around, but overall, not too bad.\n - The classes are great and included with your membership, which was a big bonus, considering a lot of other gyms charge for classes. I've gone to a few and highly recommend a cycling class with Mckenzie - I don't think I've ever sweat so much in my life.\n\nCONS: \n - The front door \"greeters\" don't greet you. At all. They either scan your card or leave the little scanner out for you to do it yourself so they don't have to make eye contact with you.\n - There are a total of four water fountains for this 5 billion sq. ft. facility.\n - The sign \"don't drop your weights\" is either unread, ignored, or unable to be read by those tossing their 1,500-lb weights to the floor. For those who can read: watch your feet.\n - Far too many annoying grunting noises (if you look/feel like you're having a heart attack, maybe you shouldn't be lifting quite so much?) and male adolescent conversations that involve a lot of \"dudes\" and expletive female body parts. Bring your iPod or endure the TMI, your choice.\n - The pool is ALWAYS crowded with 2-3 people per lane, despite what your lying sales rep tells you. And if you can figure out when its hours are, then you just might be that lucky third person to the lane. \n - The music consists of either newer slow songs or golden 70s and 80s elevator music.

Beware this is not a place to go with a big party, and beware they charge $100.00 for the private room and with big parties they don't allow you to sit anywhere else then the private room. They add on tips and the service sucks.. They don't allow splitting the checks. The power went out our server never came to check on us once during the outage, if it wasn't for the bus boy we never would have gotten our drinks refilled, and it took 2.5 hours to get our food.. we attempted to make reservations earlier that day but they don't open til 5pm we called at 450pm and we're able to make a reservation were told that they would waived the room fee, when we got there they hunted me down to question me about the fee. I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children. After the 2.5 hour wait for dinner we couldn't wait to get out of there and I was to hot and exhausted from complaining about the stupid room fee to stay and complain about the awful service. I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways. Thank you Capos for making our yearly Vegas family vacation dinner memorable in a bad way.

strip. The rooms have a full window and allows you open the drapes from wall to wall, nothing like going to sleep with a beautiful view and waking up looking at the clouds in the sky, very peaceful. The air conditioning worked wonderfully and ran at 65 degrees during my stay. The pools were great and it wasn't crowded. It is far away from the strip but it is peaceful with a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThe kids have so many options with the movies, boweling and arcade. So many choices of places to eat, food court  yard house, and lucille's. \n\nThings that need to be worked on to make this place 5 stars is the free WiFi never is in service and won't connect and you get awful cell connection. The Grand cafe service is slow, waited an hour for 2 chicken Ceasars salads and a burger with fries.  \n\nHopefully these little things will get better cause I can't wait to come back and explore the other side of Vegas red rock national mountains.

The crowd is mixed, not all trendy hipsters (not that I'm against trendy hipsters, I just like variety), and fun.  I met fun people at the bar, and met some fun girls in the ladies room line.  The view is of course fabulous.  And the second time we got in the VIP section, which doesn't really seem much different than the rest of the place and not that hard to get into.  My new drink discovery at this bar: Sugar free red bull and peach vodka (thanks, bathroom chick).  It gives you wings.\n\nThey don't have Jagermeister.

The postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! You can ship stuff all over the world, it is cheaper to use the the US Postal Servie, then any of those private shipping companies - FedEx, UPS, DHL.........etc.\n\nLast month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.\n\nWhile I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.\n\nAs a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! \nDon't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to \"travel efficiently\", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!\n\nHow does the Post Office come into play? \n\nWell, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).\n\nBut that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything \"liquid\" or \"paste\" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.\n\nCatch my drift???\n\nSo after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - \"Flat Rate\" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!\n\nWhaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!\n\nSo if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.\n\nJust an FYI..........\n\nLarge Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! \n\nMedium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!\n\nThis Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed). \nIn my case...........I shipped my box out on Sunday, and used the kiosk! No problemo gang! Easy bruddah! Winning!!!!\n\nWhat a great service that the US Postal Service provides!

Las Vegas, I like to stop by this outlet mall near the Las Vegas McCarran International airport area............... the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal, you may consider checking this mall out. To me, it's like any other outlet mall that I would go to in California, or in my home state- da 808. \nOnly difference is this particular outlet mall in Las Vegas is Mega Huge!!!! Therefore, this outlet mall probably has more stores then your average outlet mall...........\n\nIf you're not into shopping, this mall still has a purpose................ as you can walk this huge mall for exercise! \nA nice feature about the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet is that this mall is an \"indoor mall\", so in the hot summers you won't have to worry about the extreme Las Vegas heat, and in the winter you won't have to worry about the cold weather either.\n\nThere are tons of stores in this mall, as well as two food courts. Some of my favorite stores I like to check out are - Nike, Under Armour, Quiksilver, Converse, & Vans.\n\nThe list of stores at this outlet mall are pretty endless........too many stores to mention here, so I will just post a link so you can see the various stores & eateries at this outlet mall.\n\nhttp://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/las-vegas-south/stores\n\nIf for some reason you don't have a car to get to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall, no need to fret, as there is a smaller version of this outlet mall near the downtown Las Vegas area called - the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet. \n\nThe North Premium Outlet may not be as big, or have as much stores, but if you just happen to stay at a hotel in the downtown area like - the California Hotel, Fremont, Four Queens, Golden Nugget, Main Street, The D, Plaza Hotel, or Downtown Grand Hotel, the North Premium Outlet Mall is not too far away from these downtown hotels........... \n\nYou can probably take a long walk, catch a bus, or

wonderful reviews from my Yelp Buddies - da FAMOUS Auntie - Nadine C., Denise T., Gem S., Michael C., & Angel H., it was time to get reacquainted with The Buffet at the Bellagio.\n\nI came to the Bellagio to try the buffet many years ago (I think around 1998 or 1999), and haven't gone back since. \nI don't know why it took so long for me to come back here, as I remembered when I did try it back in the late 90's, it was a pretty darn good buffet, with the exception of remembering that they served very small servings of food. \nNow don't worry gang.............it's a buffet, so you can keep coming back for more! I guess the small servings are a great idea, that way you get to try the various items that the buffet would offer.\n\nIt's year 2016, and all I can say is - \"I'm Baaaaaaaaaack!!!!\" \n\nI took my pops & cousin to the Bellagio so they could enjoy the wonderful buffet at the Bellagio! The quality of food is top notch, and the offerings & selections is huge!\n\nSome of my favorites at this buffet is the Prime Rib & Mussels. \n\nThey also had Kobe Beef, Turkey, & Ham too at the carving station. If you like pasta & pizza........they had that too. They also had a station where they served Asian themed food, like won ton soup, & Char Shu. \nThen there was seafood, like the cold crab, as well as fish, & mussels.\n\nThe desserts were to die for...........if you have a sweet tooth like me, you can kill your sweet addiction by visiting this dessert buffet! There are just too many things to mention here!\n\nService by the waiter, as well as the chef at the carving station was not the friendliest, but I'm not here to experience top notch service. I was here to throw down & EAT! \n\nBut if you need to know about my service experience...........when I was seated, the table they placed us on was still dirty, as when I had put my cellular phone down on the table, there was some kind of sticky substance on the table, making my phone dirty. \nI told the waiter when he had time, if he could kindly clean up the table again........and I'm not sure if he got irritated about that? After that, while were were dining, not once did the waiter come by to check on us. When I ran out of hot tea, I had to flag down our waiter to get a refill.\n\nOn the bright side, at least the busboy was very quick to remove the dirty plates once we finished our meals, so at no time was the table left with stacked plates.\n\nFor $35.99 per person, the Buffet at the Bellagio is still a great bargain for the type of food they offer! Check 'em out gang!

when I came here, I had no expectations that I would be eating some ono fried chicken!!!\n\nWhile I was driving to Trader Joe's in downtown Summerlin, I just so happen to pass a In-n-Out burger joint, so I told my pops that I wanted to stop by for a burger.\nWhen I actually got to that In-n-Out joint, I realized that the In-n-Out was a brand new restaurant, and that the restaurant had not opened yet (they were closed for a team meeting), as they were still putting the final touches to the restaurant.\n\nFrom there, I noticed a Raising Cane's restaurant next door...........being that I'm from da 808, we don't have any Raising Cane's out here, so I figured we'd drop on in to see what they had to offer.\n\nUpon walking into the joint, I was stund, as I realized this place was pretty popular..........I mean the joint was PACKED!!!!!\n\nWhile waiting in line, I looked over the wall menu, and I guess Raising Cane's is similar like a Chick-Fil-A, as they only serve chicken here..........frrrrrried chicken that is! (Which is perfect for me!).\n\nAlthough the line was long, the clerk was very efficient & moved the line quickly. Upon getting to the ordering counter, I ordered the following items -\n\n1. The Sandwich Combo ($6.28) - which consisted of a 3 Chicken Fingers,  Cane's special sauce, Lettuce, Kaiser Roll, Crinkle Cut Fries, & a Drink from the open soda fountain. \n\n2. The 3 Finger Combo ($6.47) - which consisted of 3 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Fries, Cane's special sauce, Texas Toast, & a Drink from the open soda fountain.\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nYou gotta new fan here from da 808! The fried chicken fingers was OUTSTANDING!!! \nThe chicken pieces were plump, juicy, crunchy, & did not taste oily at all! I really enjoyed how they did the chicken! To top it off, that Cane's special sauce was awesome too! Not sure what's in that special sauce, but if you told me it was crack, I'd probably believe you! Lol!\n\nWhat an unexpected pleasant experience dining here! Should I ever visit the downtown Summerlin area again, I'll be sure to stop by Raising Cane's again!\n\nTo my friends from da 808, chance 'em gang!

A big MAHALO to the Golden Nugget for the comp. room! I must say, the Golden Nugget is by far the best hotel within the downtown Las Vegas area.\n\nThe accommodations were wonderful, as the room we had at the Rush Tower was very spacious, clean, and well kept. The room was all so quite too, so you don't hear any of the noises from the outside light show from the Fremont Experience.\n\nI didn't realize it, but there are a lot of restaurants and bars within this hotel property....they are -\n\n1. Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse\n2. The Chart House\n3. Grotto Ristorante\n4. Lillie's Asian Cuisine\n5. Red Sushi\n6. The Buffet\n7. Cadillac Mexican Cantina and Tequila Bar\n8. Claim Jumper Restaurant\n9. Starbucks\n10. Gold Diggers\n11. Rush Lounge\n12. Claude's Bar\n13. Ice Bar\n14. Bar 46\n15. Stage Bar\n16. H2O Bar\n17. The Hideout at H2O\n\nSo you can see there is no shortage of places to visit within the hotel property. Looking for a downtown hotel?

Washington Ave., and I must say I really liked that store! \n\nThis past Thursday when I made my Trader Joe's run, I decided to venture out to the Trader Joe's store in the south Summerlin neighborhood, as the store is located on Summa Drive.\n\nWhat can I say about the Trader Joe's store on Summa Drive?\n\nAlthough the store is a wee bit further out from the downtown Las Vegas strip, getting out to the Summerlin neighborhood was totally worth it, as the Summerlin neighborhood is like visiting the - Kahala / Hawaii Kai neighborhood (for you Hawaii folks..........you know what I mean!).\n\nUpscale, and very safe neighborhood, with a lot of other strip mall businesses nearby........... \n\nThis particular Trader Joe's store appears to be a little smaller than the store on W. Washington Ave., but it has all the basic items that I was looking for.\n\nThe parking lot for the Trader Joe's is shared by other businesses, but the parking lot itself was sizable enough, so I didn't have any issues finding parking while shopping at Trader Joe's.\n\nA quick tip............which may draw us Hawaii folks to this location! While I was driving up to this Trader Joe's store, I noticed just a short block away there was an \"In-n-Out Burger\"! \nIf fact, I actually drove down to that particular In-n-Out burger joint to try & get a burger there, only to find out that the store was brand new (not opened yet), as they had a \"orientation meeting\" that day.\nMaybe next time I visit the Trader Joe's, I'll made a side trip to In-n-Out.

That the hotel room is clean. Check!\n\n2. That the place is safe, & you will not get robbed.

All three are very popular with the Hawaii crowd.\n\nBesides all the gambling & fun...........part of the Las Vegas experience is the eating too! \n\nOne of my all time favorite things I like to eat is the Fried Chicken from the Fremont Hotel's buffet.\n\nThe buffet in the Fremont hotel is not as large, but has enough section of things to choose from. \n\nLast night - it was Steak night, and I went with my dad to have dinner. I wasn't there for the steak..........I was there for only one thing..........the FRIED CHICKEN (see pic)!\n\nUmmmmm........Fried Chicken! What can I say............they know how to do it right! \nBig Meaty pieces of chicken, fried to perfection, & seasoned just right!

wonderful idea to make an \"all in one\" rental-a-car center.\n\nThe McCarran Rent-a-Car Center in Las Vegas is probably one of my 1st experience using an \"all in one\" rental car facility. \nAfter looking up the McCarran Rent-a-Car Center on Google, it says that the Las Vegas facility opened up back in year 2007, with the Sacramento International Airport being the very first facility (in the U.S.) to open this type of rental car facility back in year 1998.\n\nThe McCarran Rent-a-Car Center is huge, and houses not only a lot of brands of rental car businesses, but it also houses a Starbucks coffee house, a store to buy last minute items (magazines & toiletries), and slot machines for you folks who love to gamble, and cannot wait to get to the casino! Lol!\n\nThe bus ride from the McCarran Airport to the Rent-a-Car facility is fast, (like about 7 to 10 minutes or so)...........after taking care of your paperwork for your rental, just head to the garage & pick up your rental car!\nWhen you are done with your rental car, the renta-a-car facility has an easy drop off return area by brand of rental car.\n\nA very easy peasy concept to meet all your rental car needs!</td><td>23.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>McCarran Rent-a-Car Center</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(i, love, this, rental, car, facility,, as, it's,

It is a meaty, breaded, fried meat patty, which you can add on the white mushroom gravy, & throw it into a biscuit! \nYeah, it maybe a little unhealthy............but so long as you don't eat it everyday...........it's all about moderation right? Add in a little scrambled egg & cut fried potatoes and we are good to go!\n\nThis buffet is so big, they offer the basic breakfast meats - bacon, ham, sausages, egg & Portuguese sausages. \nThere is also many types of fruit if you're looking for something healthy...........and they do offer the oatmeal, waffles, & pastries too.  \n\nToo many items to eat in one sitting I must say, but at least you can try a little at a time when you go to this place........\n\nBreakfast is very inexpensive...........even cheaper if you have Boyd Beconnected Card.  \n\nService is pretty good..........no bad

current generation of kids, as I see less kids going out to get their driver's license. \nAs for my generation, I was driving since I was 14, and got my driver's license when I \nwas 15 years old. \n\nTo me, having a driver's license meant potential independence once I was old enough to buy my own car, and being around cars all my life, one can't help but fall in love with the car..........which brings me to a place called - The Auto Collection in the LinQ hotel.\n\nThe LinQ hotel was formally called the Imperial Palace Hotel, but a recent renovation to this particular hotel, there has been a name change & a full restoration of this hotel.\n\nThe Auto Collection is not located in the LinQ hotel per se; the auto museum is actually attached to the LinQ parking garage on the 5th floor.\n\nCost to get into the museum is $12.95 per adult, $8.95 for seniors, $7.95 for children 12 years and under. \nChildren who are 5 years and under, can go in here for free with an adult.\n\nThe museum is opened from Monday to Saturday 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. They are closed on Sunday.\n\nTIP = If you look on-line and Google - \"The Auto Collection\" you can print out a coupon where you can buy a ticket, and get another person in for free.\n\nI actually printed out a coupon before I flew out to Las Vegas, but it doesn't help if I forgot my coupon at home..........shucks! \nAlso, they do not accept the coupon if you try to show them the coupon on your smart phone (it is stated on the free coupon ad); they do require you to physically print out the coupon to use it.\n\nThough the years, I've been to this car museum 4 times, and each time I came here the inventory of cars change, as most of these vintage & classic cars are for sale too.\n\nIf you like vintage hot rods like me, they have it here! \nYou like luxury classics, they have that too. \nAnd if you like rare & exotic cars, or cars formally owned by celebrities........you may even find that here too. \n\nWhen I came to The Auto Collection the other day, the few cars that stood out for me this time were -\n\n1. 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Fastback or \"Eleanor\", the car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". So beautiful that car, and how can you not love AMERICAN MUSCLE Cars?\n\n2. 1970 Dodge Charger R/T 440 Magnum this car was also featured in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". A black sinister looking car, with a NASTY 440 Magnum Engine to boot!\n\n3. 1963 Chevrolet Nova Memorial Race Car. This car was built in dedication for all the fallen & living US Marine solders of the Iraq war.\n\n4. 1955 Cadillac Series 75 Fleetwood Limousine. What's special about this car? It was Elvis Presley's 1st Cadillac Limo. How can you not love Elvis? Lol!\n\n5. 1939 Chrysler Royale Sedan. What's so good about this car? Well, this car belonged to the KING OF LATE NIGHT - Johnny Carson. Well, actually it was Johnny Carson's dad's car.  Johnny Carson used this car to take his date to the senior prom, and many years later when Johnny Carson became rich & famous, he tracked down his father's car, bought it, and fully restored it. In 1994, Johnny Carson sold this car to the Imperial Palace Hotel for $1.00. This car is NOT for sale by the way.\n\n6. 1971 Dodge Challenger Convertible. I'm not much of a rag top man, but I do admit I like the design, & the fine lines of the Challenger. I must tip my hat off to Dodge, as I feel they did an awesome job in the current 4th generation Challenger, which they introduced back in 2008.\n\n7. 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 Roadster. When people talk about AMERICAN Sports Cars, an easy name will come up...........the Corvette! I like all Corvettes, I even have it on my bucket list, and hope one day to own one.\n\nLooking for something to do in Las Vegas besides gambling, shopping, or eating?

the airport.

\"The Habit Burger Grill\" stores outside of California?\n\nYes, they have Habit Burger Grill's in the following states of - Arizona, Utah, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, & Pennsylvania. \n\nOversea's? \nThey sure do, with (2) stores in the United Arab Emirates, and (2) stores in China.\n\nTotal Habit Burger stores? 243 stores my friend............(Thank you Google!).\n\nWhat can I say about my 1st experience at \"The Habit Burger Grill\", inside the Fashion Show Mall food court in Las Vegas?\n\nThe Habit Burger Grill kinda reminds me of In-n-Out Burger...........(we don't have In-n-Out's either in the 808!)\n\nThe burgers are reasonably priced, as you can get a Charburger here for just $3.89! Can we say Dealages Yo!!!!\n\nThe day we stopped by The Habit Burger Grill, we ended up getting a Charburger ($3.89), a Teriyaki Char ($4.19), & a Veggie Burger ($5.45).\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I don't do red meat..........\nAlthough the Veggie Burger had a large amount of lettuce & tomatoes, but the veggie patty was kinda bland tasting..........worst yet, since I recently had a veggie burger from another major burger joint in the 808, I had something to compare it to, and realized the Veggie Burger at The Habit Burger Grill fell a little short.\n\nAs for the Teriyaki Char, & the Charburger? \nYes, those are great burgers, as my pops & cousin really enjoyed their burgers!\n\nIf you're not into red meat like myself, there are other options as I saw they offered several types of chicken sandwiches.\n\nIf you don't wanna do a sandwich, they also offer fresh salads. \n\nHave a sweet tooth? \n\nThe Habit Burger Grill also has shakes, malts, cones, & sundaes too!\n\nI probably just ordered the wrong item............next time I come across a Habit Burger Grill...........I'll do the chicken, & update my review.

week, I decided to take my cousin, & dad to try this place...........\n\nI must say, the modern decor of this place was quite beautiful.........but as for the food I consumed, I'd give it a  solid \"3.5\". \nFor me, some of the items I ate was either a - \"hit\" or \"miss\"......... \n\nA lot of the items they serve here are in a \"small bite size portion\", perfect for the eater to just try a little of this & that.......... \n\nWhat is bad about serving a \"small individual portion\" for a buffet is that sometimes the item can go cold, therefore when you eat it, it may not be of the right temperature to consume, losing the benefit of how it was actually meant to be served.\n\nThe buffet was HUGE! Lots of different dishes............I probably didn't even get to try 2/3 of the buffet, as I was pretty full after eating two plates of food, then having a little salad on the side & deserts.\n\nA few items that I ate, which were a \"hit\" for me, and stood out  -\n\n1. Prime Rib - Not bad.............it was done right, but the meat was not of the best grade. I've had prime rib in Wisconsin where the meat was so soft, I could cut it with a fork.\n\n2. Kalbi Ribs - The Marinade was out of this world! Only bad thing was the meat was a bit tough & chewy.\n\n3. Bone Marrow - Not much to eat, but I don't know of any place that serves bone marrow. Something very unique.\n\n4. Mussels & Oysters  - This was done right.........ate a lot of it too!\n\n5. Fried Chicken drumstick - Served in a small individual basket..........chicken was done perfectly, as it was crispy and flavorful.\n\n6. Waldorf Salad - An all time 1st for me...........never had it, but I liked it. Probably cuz it had grapes in the salad, and I like grapes.\n\n7. Cheesecake & Chocolate covered Strawberry - All deserts were served \"bite size\" portions. The cheesecake was outstanding! I really loved the texture of the cheesecake. As for the chocolate covered Strawberry..........I just love strawberries, and when you dip it in chocolate...........how can you go wrong???\n\nThe service was outstanding! Our waiter was very friendly, & he was quick to remove our dirty plates after we had finished eating. \n\nLots of free parking at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The place gets pretty packed during the prime times, so go early if you don't want to wait. $38.00 per person during the weekdays for dinner. $41.00 for dinner on the weekends.

Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!\n\nApparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987! \nThey have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.\n\nAs we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. \n\nUpon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!\n\nOne of my friends also picked the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an \"Arnold Palmer?\" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......\n\nMy other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say \"Sugar Overload?\" Lol!\n\nWhat can I say about my meal?\n\nLove it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!\nThe hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!\n\nService was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!\n\nWhat away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........\n\nI would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast!

Of course you get ice cream! But a big dummy like me..........I came here to get a cup of coffee.  :(\n\nIf was a very hot afternoon (102 degrees), and I didn't feeling like walking to the Golden Nugget Hotel for Starbucks, or to the Fremont Hotel for Dunkin Donuts coffee, so I went upstairs to the Mezzanine level of the California Hotel & stopped by Lappert's Ice Cream Shop for coffee.\n\nBesides ice cream, they serve coffee here, as well as Winchell's Donuts. I've never had a Winchell's donut, but I see Winchell's all over the place in southern California.\n\nUpon walking into the shop, I decided to get a cup of coffee, but lucky for me.........they had this deal where you buy a 16 oz. cup of their gourmet coffee, you get a free Winchell's donut (wot a deal!).\n\nWell, after getting my cup of coffee............I realized the coffee really isn't too gourmet........... \n\nIn fact the coffee tasted a little burnt to me, as I think the coffee was on the heating pot for too long of a period, \nTo top if off, the free glazed donut I got was hard too! YUCK! I guess they probably have the Winchell's donuts/pastries shipped in, so who knows how long it sits before it gets served, \nIt would probably be better if you get the donuts from a Winchell's shop

LoL! \n\nHey man, it's all about moderation right? LoL! \n\nService here is pretty good, as the waiter or waitress is pretty attentive.

various soda flavors of Coke, as I stopped drinking soda back in 2014. \nI did buy a soda for my pops, and a Dasani water for myself..........and I must say the bottled water was real cheap at

They have a few useful amenities like a small fridge, flat screen t.v., hair dryer, iron & ironing board, & a little safe so you can keep your loot inside, so you don't have to carry so much money on you.\n\n5. Free self parking, but they also valet if you choose to use it.\n\n6.

As an alumni of the University of Hawaii........isn't it the right thing to do?\n\nThe Sam Boyd Stadium is not too far from the Sam Boyd's downtown hotels........I wanna say it's probably about 12 to 15 miles away, and very easy to find.\n\nA few things I like about this little stadium -\n\n- Free parking........yeah most of it is on a dirt road, but who cares? FREE PARKING! Get it?\n\n-  Food & Drinks are a little cheaper than what I would pay at the Aloha Stadium. For instance...........Beer here is just $7 bucks, where as I pay $9.50 at home.\n\nBut a bad thing about this place -\n\nThere is no individual seating........just a hard metal bench seating. The good thing is you can pack more people into this little stadium, but the bad thing is.......if the game runs long, it can be pretty hard on your butt!\n\nThis is a outdoor stadium.........and we Hawaii folks are not use to the \"cold\" in the winter time. \n\nI don't know what I was thinking when I came up here............as I was just planning on just bringing up shorts, t-shirt, & a light jacket. Lucky for me, my smart girlfriend told me that it would not be wise, and that I should wear pants & layer my shirts. Thanks Jules Y.! You da bestest & smartest gf!\n\nAnd you know what? As the sun came down..........and it turned into night.......it was quite nippy at the stadium. I see a few Hawaii bruddah's who went with shorts & t-shirts.........and I could see they were a little uncomfortable. But as for me.........I was warm as a puppy dog.......with the exception on when I left the stadium, and the winds picked up! MAN! It was so cold..........I felt like a frozen Popsicle! I had to blast that heater in the car for a little while.............but I was okay. \n\nAlthough we lost again, and took a beat down from UNLV. At least I was happy to see a lot of Hawaii people supporting the University of Hawaii Football program! \n\nThe people of Las Vegas were nice, and there was definitely good sportsmanship, as there were no fights or taunting.</td><td>9.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>Sam Boyd Stadium</td><td>3.0</td><td>List(i've, been, coming, here, every, other,

I was in Ba Ba Barbeque heaven!!!!\n\nThe restaurant was really packed, and as we walked to the counter, the friendly clerk took our orders. After you order your food, you find an open table (good luck), and when your food is ready, they will bring your order out to you.\n\nThere is a Sauce station within the restaurant where you can get additional BBQ sauce. I want to point out.........try the \"Mama Sweet\" BBQ sauce! It was bomb @ss good! My friend liked this BBQ sauce so much, I actually saw him put it in a little cup & drink the sauce! That's how much he loved the BBQ sauce!\n\nBefore you sit down at your table, you will also have to get your own plastic eating utensils, napkins, as well as your own drinks, as the soda fountain within the restaurant was self serve.\n\nFor my meal that night, I ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\" - where I picked the following - Brisket, 1/4 Chicken, & 2 Spare Ribs. ($17.99)\n\nOne of my friends also ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\"  - where he picked the Brisket, 2 Spare Ribs, & Hot Links. ($17.99)\n\nAnd my other friend ordered the \"Duo Choice Of 2 Meats\" - where he picked the Brisket, & Pulled Pork. ($13.99)\n\nWith our meals came with a side, and I ended up taking the corn bread. All of our meals came with collard greens, and the collard greens had some kind of smoked meat mixed inside.\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI totally loved the BBQ Chicken! The chicken meat was all so soft, and the meal literally fell off the bone.......nice smokey flavor too! \nThe spare ribs was also delicious, and I just loved how the meat came off of the bone so easily! I really loved how soft the BBQ ribs were....... \nAs for the brisket.........it was just okay for me. Loved the smokey flavor, but I gotta tell you the brisket wasn't very soft. I've had better tasting brisket on Oahu.......from \"Verde\" in Kaimuki.\n\nOverall a pretty good barbeque joint! No frills..........kinda of place, and they definitely churn out some pretty great barbeque meats! \n\nBe careful of your surroundings when coming here........if I was with my girlfriend, I'd probably pass on this place.........my friend also mentioned to me that if he was here with his wife & kids, he'd probably do the same.</td><td>10.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>Rollin Smoke Barbeque</td><td>4.5</td><td>List(i, love, my, ba, ba, barbeque, baby!, and, after, going, to, the, u.h.,

was pretty much okay.\n\nI basically booked a economy car on-line for $24.79 per day, and upon arriving in Las Vegas I was able to walk right up to the line & visit a customer service representative right away with no wait. \nAfter doing the paperwork, and buying the (LDW - Loss Damage Waiver) for my rental, I was off to the parking lot to pick up my car.\n\nAs I headed off to the parking lot to pick up my rental car, a lot attendant told me I could pick any car from \"Zone 5\". \nWhen I got to \"Zone 5\" there were only two (2) cars left in Zone 5, and guess what? Both cars were already taken, so I thought to myself.............they told me to go to Zone 5 to get a car...........what car????? Lol!\n\nSo I walked back to the Dollar parking lot booth to tell the lot attendant that there wasn't anymore cars. From there, the lot attendant tells me to go to \"Zone 3\" to get a car..........this worked out for me, as I actually got an upgraded car from Zone 3.\n\nEverything else from there went smoothly for my rental car............on issues here.\n\nReturning my rental car went smoothly too, as the processed me quickly, and all I had to do was just show the rental car clerk that I had purchased gas with a gas receipt when I returned my car.\n\nOverall, it was just an okay experience.................if I had anything bad to say about Dollar Rental Car, I would say that they are kinda expensive! \n\nAlthough I got a great rate on my rental car ($24.79 per day), with the insurance (LDW -  at $80.64) they charged me, and I saw something they charged me on the bill called - \"Premium Road Service\" for an additional $8.99 per day (I don't remember asking for that). \n\nYou add in the various taxes you have to pay at the airport, my grand total ended up at $243.90 for just 3 days use of a rental car.\n\nNot sure if that was a good deal, but on the bright side, I didn't have to wait very long in line to do the paperwork for my rental car, I got a car upgrade, & the car was basically brand new, and it was basically a no hassle rental experience.............that's Dollar for

since I stayed at the Main Street Hotel. I remembered when they had remodeled the place, and I had stayed here and had a pleasant experience.\n\nNow it's 2015............and I'm back! Had to find a hotel to stay at as I went to the UNLV vs. the University of Hawaii Football game this past weekend.\n\nWhat can I say about the place? Well I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the room was, and it was also very clean. \nThe room had all the basic stuff - hair dryer, flat screen t.v., refrigerator, & ironing board and iron.\n\nAgain, the best thing about this place..........it was very clean! (Did I mention that? Lol!) \n\nSo why the \"3\" rating instead of \"4\" or \"5\"? Well, after having a wonderful stay at the Main Street Hotel.........as I was checking out, I received the rudest treatment from this older Asian lady that was handling the customers at the reception counter. \n\nWhen I was about to check out of the hotel to leave Las Vegas, I noticed there was a bit of a line......... \nI figured, no big deal........I'll just wait. But then I realized this lady was very slow........then I hear her bark out - \"anyone checking out\" please come forward.\n\nAs I waited for my turn, when I finally get to the counter, this lady rudely told me - \"Didn't you hear me? I said people who were checking out to come here 1st as they were a priority.\" \n\nI then replied back to her, without trying to be rude..........but I basically told her - \"Yes, I did hear you...........but hey, everyone else is waiting in line, and the last thing I need to do is cut in front of someone, only to make somebody mad!\"\n\nShe then didn't say anything to me........but as I looked over at the long line, everyone who heard me, and was waiting in line gave me the - \"You're right, and your an okay dude - nod!\"\n\nIf she was so concerned about the long line, she could have either done the following......\n\n1. Work faster.\n\n2. Call someone from the back to assist her, because obviously she wasn't getting it done.\n\nThis lady also needs to refresh her customer service skills..........\n\nYeah, the hotel was cheap..........I paid about $125.00 per night, but still.......it doesn't allow you to be rude to others.......this little incident just ruined my stay at this wonderful

Lol!!!\n\nAfter checking in at Hawaiian Airlines, passing the TSA screening area, catching the monorail to Terminal 3.........it was time to sit down, relax, & get something to eat before I board my flight home.\n\nAfter walking around Terminal 3, I found this place called Baja Fresh \"Express\" Mexican Grill. It was a good place I could grab something quick..........food was edible, but of course nothing like I would get at a restaurant. But the convenience factor was spot on!\n\nOrdered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's & two soda's.............aaaah, breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know, the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor, and probably the vendor's high rent, & taxes.\n\nThe food......well, the breakfast burrito was quite BIG, it was loaded with eggs, potatoes, & one type of meat. I ended up taking bacon for my meat. Everything about the breakfast burrito was okay, with the exception of the bacon which was kinda soggy & rubbery. If they had cooked the bacon to a crisp, then loaded it in the burrito, I'm sure it would have tasted a little better......but what do you expect for airport food???? \nIt's all about convenience

for the Memorial Day weekend, and while I was surfing the internet to look for a deal on a rental car, I came across the the best rate on Thrifty Rental Car.\nGang, BIG MISTAKE for renting over here! \n\nThis is what happened to me.......... \n\n1. Although I landed on time in Las Vegas, when I finally get to the rental car depot station, I ended up waiting in an extremely long line which took me over an 1 hour 30 minutes, until it got to my turn to the customer counter.\n\n2, Normally if I knew I was gonna get this type of service......... I would have just bailed out of the line, and head straight to the Avis Rental Car booth, but since I made a reservation with Thrifty, and they already charged a $100.00 to my credit card, I was locked in, so they had me by the Ba*ls!\n\n3. On my rental car confirmation voucher, after charging my credit card a $100.00, it stated that the balance payable at the counter was $57.80. This is for a rental car for 3 days & a few hours.\n\nThis is what I ended up paying for the 3 days & a few hours......... $266.78....wtf?\n\nIf you're gonna bend me over like that..........please at least use some \"lube\" on me, because I butt still hurts!!!!!\n\nUpon looking at my bill, I asked for the LDW (Loss Damage Waiver) because you never know when you could possibly get into an accident, and I see the charge of $102.80!\n\nSo to sum it up my experience........I really didn't get a great deal, and should have used Avis.\n\nI waited forever in an endless line, where all I heard was angry people moaning & bitching about the wait, as there were only 4 representatives working at the counter at 12 AM.\nI think everyone waiting could have used a Snickers that morning!</td><td>11.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>Thrifty Car Rental</td><td>2.0</td><td>List(i, took, my, pops, to, las, vegas, for, the, memorial, day, weekend,,

They sold me the cup for coffee, and told me I had to go across the way to a place called Einstein Bros. Bagel to get my coffee.\n\nLucky for me.........I think the burrito joint did me a big favor, as I've never had Einstein Bros. coffee before. \nI must say the coffee was rich & flavorful!

forget your smart phone or camera? \nDo you panic? Do you cry? Do you feel helpless? \n\nOr are you like me.........\"Don't worry.......be happy!\" :)\n\nSo......... I went on a short vacation to the mainland, and since United Airlines canceled my flight to San Francisco/Las Vegas, and rerouted me through Los Angeles/Las Vegas, everything was turned upside down for me.\n\nIt all started the night before I left, as I had to go to the gym to get one last workout, and upon getting home, I had to pack for my trip.\n\nQuick tip for your folks (be smart, don't be like me)..........it's NOT a good idea to pack the day before you leave, but what cha' gonna do if you gotta work? \nNext time I think I will skip out on my nighttime workout, and stay home and pack my bags instead.\n\nAnyways, I finally get to bed around 1:45 am, and told my friend to swing by my house at 7:15 am, as I had to be at the airport at around 7:30 am. \n\nI went to bed, and next thing you know..........I wake up at 7:45 am! As soon as I woke up and realized I should be at the airport, panic set in, and the mayhem began! \nI ran out the house with just my shorts on, just to see if my friend was waiting for me downstairs by the gate. \nSure enough, he was there..........steady like Freddy!\n\nI ran back into my house, threw on a shirt, slipped on my shoes, and gang,........I kid you not.........I didn't even brush my teeth, or comb my hair. I just grabbed my wallet, and out the door I went, only to realize when my friend was driving me to the airport, that I had forgotten my phone! YIKES! Ouch!\n\nWell, I must say..........it's good to be unplugged for a few days. No need to answer to anyone, and if someone calls me while I'm on vacation........well, they will just have to wait till I get back home.\n\nAfter a few days on the mainland, I was having YELP withdrawals........I mean, without a phone, how can I Yelp?????\n\nThis is where Walmart comes to my rescue!!!! \n\nI tried going to Frys Electronics to look for a cheap camera.........but the cameras weren't dirt cheap enough, so I headed out to good 'ol Walmart instead.\n\nSure enough..........I found a cheap @ss camera (Jazz Camera) for $27.00 smackers, & a $10 SD memory card........Yay! Now I'm back in action again!!!!\n\nWell, if you see some of the pics I took on my trip...........you can clearly see what a $27.00 camera can do (which is not much), that is why some of the pics are pretty blurry. \n\nBut oh well, better than nothing yeah? I won't feel bad if this camera gets lost, or breaks..........because I consider this a \"throw away\" camera.\n\nI'm glad where ever you go........there is usually a Walmart around in the neighborhood, as they sell almost everything, and anything. \n\nBut the best part about going to Walmart, is that you can get a certain item like a digital camera real cheap!

Is it shave ice? Is it ice cream? Well, to be honest.......it's neither! It's rather hard to describe this unique dessert........but the best way to describe it, I would say it's like a gurl gurl (the same kinda stuff I got on Maui), but Kuma Snow Cream offers more flavors, & toppings.\n\nAfter eating that puny lobster sandwich from Lobster Me, I was still pretty hungry so my friends mentioned that we go to this place called Kuma Snow Cream. I guess my friend's daughter had turned him onto this treat, so my friend suggested we go here to try it.\n\nWhere is Kuma Snow Cream located? Just get on Spring Mountain Road, and head to the Chinatown area of Las Vegas. It's pretty easy to find, as it's not too far from the Las Vegas strip.\n\nAs we walked into the shop, I noticed a lot of bright colored toppings, as well as flavors. \n\nUpon scanning the menu, I decided to order a dessert called - \"Boo Boo's Taro\". What is in the Boo Boo's Taro? Well, it is a snow cream Taro, topped with Lychee, Gummy Bears, Popping Pearls, & a Mango Sauce.\n\nMy two friends order the following -\n\nBruce Tea - which was snow cream Green Tea, topped with Mochi, Red Bean, Popping Pearls, & Condensed Milk.\n\nBanana Bomb - which was snow cream Banana, topped with Strawberry Pearl, Almonds, Whipped Cream, & Chocolate Sauce.\n\nWhat can I say about my dessert?\n\nLoved it! The taro snow cream had the texture and consistency like the gurl gurl that I had on Maui. Only difference is the added toppings. I love Lychee! The Popping Pearls was unique too, as when you bit into it, it would \"pop\" out some liquid. Only thing I didn't care for was the Gummy Bears on top of my dessert, as when the Gummy Bears got cold.........it was rather hard to chew on my Gummy Bears.\n\nOverall, a very cool treat! I would be back again to try more flavors. They have 3 available sizes of cups, and they are -\n\n1. Mini (The smallest serving, which looked like a pretty big serving to me) $5.00\n2. Ninja (The medium serving) $6.00\n3. Sumo (The Biggest serving) $7.50\n\nCheck 'em out gang!

Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.\n\nApparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.\n\nThis location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place. \n\nWhen we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!\n\nUpon scanning the menu, I decided to get the \"Sundance Special\", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........\n\nOne of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.\n\nWith my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!\n\nOverall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.\n\nThe menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM.</td><td>8.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>Egg Works</td><td>4.5</td><td>List(this, place, is, eggcellent!, \n\nafter, reading, my, yelp, buddy,

write a review of this wonderful dessert shop!\n\nLooking for a decadent treat? The Jean Philippe Patisserie is the place to be! They have an array of sweet treats that will satisfy any sweet tooth fan. Not only are the treats very pleasant to look at, they are also deeeeeeeelicious!\n\nThey sell crepes, fresh salads, delicious cakes, pastries, paninis sandwiches, & gelato. They also sell drinks like coffee, tea, hot cocoa, & soft drinks. \nLooking for a gift for a friend or loved one? They got that too, as they have pre-packaged gifts.\n\nOn the day I had came to Jean Philippe Patisserie, I had to exercise some real restraint, as the sweet treats served here are so amazing! But since I had some sweet treats earlier at breakfast, I had to pass on the sweet treats served here, and just get a cup of hot coffee.\n\nI must say the coffee that they serve at Jean Philippe Patisserie is very rich & flavorful, and can easily rival any Starbucks, Peets, Philz, Seattle's Best, or any other designer coffee joint.\n\nThe shop is very bright looking & clean. At times this store can get really busy with long lines, but lucky for me on the day I came here, it wasn't overly busy, so I was able to get my coffee & was in and out in no time.\n\nThere is no seating inside this shop, but just outside of the shop, there are lot of tables & comfortable chairs (inside the hotel) to sit & eat.\n\nLooking for a sweet treat, or a nice hot cup of coffee?

Since we can get it anytime........in fact, sometimes I get tired of those tropical fruits, with the exception of the Lychee! Lol!\n\n99 Ranch Market is your typical Asian themed market.

booked marked this place, as I knew the next time I was in Las Vegas, I really wanted to try a lobster sandwich roll.\n\nYeah, I know.........the sandwich has mayonnaise, and for you folks that know me..........I am a totally mayonnaise hater! But hey, we are talkin' about lobster here, and not a tuna sandwich! But wait........I do like tuna sandwiches......yeah, I'm kinda weird.......I know! Go figure?\n\nSo after landing in Las Vegas, I tell my homies - \"'Eh, lets go to this place called \"Lobster Me\" for a lobster sandwich........I'm buying!\" \n\nSo off we went to the Venetian Hotel, and headed straight to the Grand Canal Shoppes where I quickly found this little food stand.\n\nLobster Me is located by a small food court within the Grand Canal Shoppes, the restaurant is basically a fast food lobster sandwich joint. You walk up to the counter, order your food & pay. They will give you a ticket number, then you will need to find an open table to sit down. \nWhen your food is ready, someone will bring it to your table.\n\nWhat did we order here?\n.\nOne of my friends & I ordered - The \"Original Main Style\" lobster roll which consisted of - Maine lobster meat with celery, chives and mayo. ($18.00 per combo).\n\nAnd my other friend ordered - The \"Beltway\" lobster roll which consisted of - Warm Maine lobster tossed with Old Bay and shallot-chive mayo. Topped with butter-toasted panko crumbs. ($18.00)\n\nMy friends also ordered an Old Fashion Lemonade ($4.00) & a Blueberry Lemonade ($8.00).\n\nWhat can I say about the grub?\n\nI must say my lobster roll was DELICIOUS! Lot of chunks of lobster, and the seasonings with the lobster made it buttery good!\n \nBut if I could properly critique this meal, what I was really disappointed of.......... was the very small portions of food that they served, in comparison to what they charged you.\n\nThe lobster sandwich was delicious, but all so small. Funny when I see the picture on the wall menu, they make it look so big, then when you get your sandwich.............I'm thinking - \"Where's the rest of my lobster sandwich!\" Lol! \n\nAs for the sides - (potato) chips & coleslaw..........the chips, I can pass on. I'm not sure if it was freshly cut & fried, but it was definitely not light tasting at all.........kinda soggy, if anything. The coleslaw serving was ridiculously small........it was just a pinch of coleslaw, about the size of a nut...........but of course, we are not here for the sides. We are here for the lobster roll!\n\nDrinks were kind of on the expensive side...........$8 bucks for a blueberry lemonade? I'd rather drink a beer! Lol!\n\nOverall, a neat little shop...........the lobster roll I'd give it a very strong \"4\", but I had to knock off a point for the puny portions that they served here.\n\nFor $71.35 - I got 3 lobster roll sandwiches, and 2 drinks.......worth it? I'm not so sure.......</td><td>11.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>6016.0</td><td>14824.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>Lobster ME</td><td>3.5</td><td>List(after, reading, my, yelp, buddies, -, yolanda, r., &, angel,

I usually get a regular pedi and a gel mani. This shop just happened to be convenient and on my way home. As he started to polish my toes it seemed to be dried out or almost empty. He added some liquid to thin it out. My toes look horrible....my nails look streaky and I have extra polish on my toes!! My gel mani is nothing like I asked for. I asked him to just barely trim my nails down and keep them square shaped.

I ordered Empanadas appetizer, Cuban Sandwich, the Lechon Entree and Black Bean soup. I will say the Empanda is the tastiest I've ever had with a flakey, buttery crust...and that is saying a lot. The Cuban sandwich is by far one of the best in The Burgh, and the Lechon...mouth, dribble, watering. My only critiques...it took 45 minutes for my order, with three 2-tops, an already prepared meat (lechon) and a basic sandwich, seemed like a very long wait. Some better expediting in the kitchen would do wonders, as well as working on multiple orders at once. Also, I'd like to see an updated menu posted somewhere, anywhere, with the right perspective (check out their FB page). I would've given 5 stars, save for the very long wait.

I've dined at the bar, the exhibition kitchen and the communal tables and have enjoyed myself every time. Plate presentation is big here and the food flavors stand out. It is a place for adventurous eaters, self proclaimed foodies and those looking for something new and exciting.\n\nWhen I was last at Salt, I tried the Rye cocktail, made with Sazerac, cinnamon and Averna, a most tasty beverage indeed.  And the Malbec is just wonderful with dinner.\n\nMy hands down favorite starter is the beet salad, red and gold beets with frisée, truffle-mustard, and poached egg. The best way to eat it is mix it all up together, then hide it from your friends. The octopus starter is one of  of the best I've had, on both coasts, tender not chewy and nicely flavored. The scallops are cooked perfectly, plated nicely and delicious. And if you really want a treat, try the Sweetbreads. Sometimes they have veal and other times they have lamb, so ask before you order if you are concerned. I personally like the lamb sweetbreads.\n\nI've enjoyed the Hanger Steak with homemade mole sauce, although last I was there, the prep has changed to bourbon dashi and soba. My friend was kind enough to let me try a bite, and it was just as fantastic. I tried the Duck, a savory dish with livers throughout the curry roasted potatoes that were wonderful, surprising treats.\n\nTry to get both desserts, the cheese and the chocolate, they are both delectable and the presentation is top-notch. I could eat both myself, they are awesome!\n\nAnd lastly, if you plan on going to a restaurant at any time on a Saturday night, you're going to wait.

logisitc regression model was able to predict accurately if a review was 5 stars or not. The most important features to the model seemed to be business names. The names had the highest weights. Also, with a lift of 2.17 shows that you can accurately predict almost 2x better then without the model. Furthermore, the cross validation showed little to no improvements. I think that if I added more hyperparamters it would help to improve the model but since I do not have a lot of time I was not able to do this.
